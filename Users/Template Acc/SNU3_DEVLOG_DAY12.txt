SNU 3.0 Developer log day 12
I have began to add Blender into legends of the internet because who said I had to stop after social media? This is for all internet content
Today, I have also resumed development on my calculator, so website development may be a little slower. I am not getting burnt out as easily anymore either
I also updated the blog documentation and exported all documents into different formats from Day 7 to Day 11, and Week 1 as well
