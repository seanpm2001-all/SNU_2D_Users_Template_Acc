<H1>3 positives for every negative</H1>
<p>On my short walk to class yesterday, I thought of a new idea: 2 positives for 1 negative is a very broken system. The percentages wouldn’t be equal enough, and it would be difficult to decide the exact percentage.</p>
<p>3 positives to 1 negative is better, as the positives would be 75% and the negative would be the other 25% it would also work well as 1-4  (1-9) 1-19 1-24 1-49 1-99.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Be more positive</p>
<p>TL:DR: More positives makes easier math</p>

<H1>Plan: rebuild my minecraft worlds</H1>
<H2>Made by Sean P. Myrick</H2>
<p>Yes, I know Minecraft isn't as popular as it once was, but it was a huge part of my childhood up until the day that I lost all my progress. I don't know what happened, my account was unable to sign in, and the launcher had errors. Keep in mind, at the time I was still using Minecraft 1.8, waiting for 1.9 to come out, a pretty long time ago.</p>
<p>When it crashed, I was in shock. I didn't think too much of it. Every time I tried to go near it again, I had issues. Lately, as of March 2019, I am really getting into it again, almost 3 full years later. I am determined to not give up now. I have the worlds still in memory (in my brain) and I am considering remaking all of the worlds.</p>
<p>There are a few requirements first:</p>
<p>• <b><i>Wait for Windows 8 to go out of support in 2025 (I thought it was already dead years ago until I looked it up today.)</i></b></p>
<p>• <b><i>Obtain a copy of Minecraft 1.8</i></b></p>
<p>• <b><i>Get better virtual machine knowledge and support (shared folders, prevent corruption from no usage (my machines randomly got corrupted one day and I don't know why) learn how to export to other machines)</i></b></p>
<p>I really hope I can do this. It might take me a very long time to do this, as I don't have as much free time anymore. It would be really nice to have everything back again! Thanks to RTGame for the videos that have peaked my interest in trying again.</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 1</H1>
<p>Today is the first day of SNU 3 development. Version 2.0 was a failure, as it wasn't possible to work with the code I had, and it had poor planning. Version 3 is already looking really good</p>
<p>Today, after more HTML testing, I decided that I should try and develop a basic HTML structure for SNU instead of depending on Google sites or Javascript any longer</p>
<p>It is almost like a sign. The HTML hyperlink error lead to so many discoveries, I began looking up how to do all these different things. Now I have</p>
<p>After I successfully managed to embed images, audio, and video into HTML, along with other skills like opening files in other folders, hosting downloads, and opening documents within documents, I moved from my HTML testing ground into the real environment</p>
<p>I am going to try and take it slowly so I don't have to restart again. I think version 3 has a lot of potential. Someday, I will get this site working</p>
<p>Today, I started out with development on the basic site elements such as pseudocode, front pages, trending, and assets. I laid the foundation today</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 2</H1>
<p>Today is another big day in Modern SNU development. I began to work on the profiles for staff and companies. Getting the layout for staff right is important, along with users (coming tomorrow) today, I just established a home base for the sites community</p>
<p>Today wasn't the most exciting day in development, but some important progress was made</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 3</H1>
<p>SNU has received a massive update today, mainly involving user profiles. I have put in lots of effort today into making a template account that mimics what a profile looks like</p>
<p>I think it is a pretty good example. However, it is going to take A LOT of work. So far, just the basic HTML is over 80 Kilobytes in size. I haven't even added any styles or many images yet</p>
<p>I burnt myself out of it for the day, and I began to port SNU 2.0 into the root folder. SNU 2.0 was a failure, but its code establishes a lot of ideas and commitments that I am going to take inspiration from and live up to</p>
<p>Just taking this one day at a time, I will eventually get a good layout finished and a good testing server.</p>
<p>Also, I am going to start using paragraphs and bolding instead of just all headings for my HTML style</p>
<p>One last thing, I have decided to start and keep documentation in the blog section of the profile test account (where you currently are) it may get copied in the future, but the original will remain here</p>

<p>I have began to add Blender into legends of the internet because who said I had to stop after social media? This is for all internet content</p>
<p>Today, I have also resumed development on my calculator, so website development may be a little slower. I am not getting burnt out as easily anymore either</p>
<p>I also updated the blog documentation and exported all documents into different formats from Day 7 to Day 11, and Week 1 as well</p>

<p>I am only including the famous pranks and raids. Hopefully, I can get something better done here tomorrow</p>

<p>I had a pretty productive day today. I got alot done in all my projects. I have been mainly working on documetation. I finished up current 4Chan documentation with the resources I currently had, and I also worked on Twitter, FaceBook, and Tumblr</p>
<p>So if you noticed with build 3.03 I have been relying heavily on Internet Historian for a lot of documentation. It is one of the easiest resources I have access to, and he does a good job at it. In the future, I will showcase other people</p>
<p>I also added a little bit of reddit and Vinesauce into internet legends</p>
<p>Overall, today was a very good day</p>

<p>I have began to add Blender into legends of the internet because who said I had to stop after social media? This is for all internet content</p>
<p>Today, I have also resumed development on my calculator, so website development may be a little slower. I am not getting burnt out as easily anymore either</p>
<p>I also updated the blog documentation and exported all documents into different formats from Day 7 to Day 11, and Week 1 as well</p>
<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 11th 2019</p>
<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 13</H2>
<p>I didn't do that much work to this site today. I exported documents and caught up the documentation, but mostly, I worked on restoring my calculator today. However, I added in some new features to the site, such as a 4chan section in Legends Of the Internet. It has a dark but interesting past</p>
<p>I am only including the famous pranks and raids. Hopefully, I can get something better done here tomorrow</p>
<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 12th 2019</p>
<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 14</H2>
<p>I had a pretty productive day today. I got alot done in all my projects. I have been mainly working on documetation. I finished up current 4Chan documentation with the resources I currently had, and I also worked on Twitter, FaceBook, and Tumblr</p>
<p>So if you noticed with build 3.03 I have been relying heavily on Internet Historian for a lot of documentation. It is one of the easiest resources I have access to, and he does a good job at it. In the future, I will showcase other people</p>
<p>I also added a little bit of reddit and Vinesauce into internet legends</p>
<p>Overall, today was a very good day</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 15</H1>
<p>I have now reached the point with this site where it is as functional as SNU 1. I can legitimately say I am browsing SNU. However, this is just the structure. The fun part comes later. However, I haven't outperformed the original SNU yet, however some of its content is finally over to the new site</p>
<p>Today, I worked on making alternates to the rich formatting versions of specific pages, increasing documentation, and working on blogs. I got a lot done again today as well. I also updated the site to version 3.04 and added Big Buck Bunny content in. Since I added over 10 gigabytes today, I have decided I will follow a new update schedule:</p>
<p>I will continue working on the site daily, but I can't make an entirely new version all the time. I can only make a new version every 4 months. This is to conserve the last 490 Gigabytes on my laptops hard drive. This is the way it will be until I get a new computer or a better spot for memory</p>
<P>It's valentines day today btw</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 16</H1>
<p>Today was a pretty good day in development. I was able to do a lot. I added a home page for the game Façade, and I actually made a working update log that is up to date. I got burnt out really bad at the end, hopefully tomorrow is better</p>
<p>There are just so many files, it is getting hard to manage, and folder switching is difficult too due to HTML limitations</p>
<p>I got a temporary burn-out on the project for the first time in 4 days, I just need a small break</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 17</H1>
<p>After some research, I decided that I need to put a little less focus on customizing menus and such and work on making the foundation for a good algorithm. There are lots of variables and conditions that go into the SNU algorithm, and it is going to take YEARS to implemeent</p>
<p>I am really hoping I don't have to make another re-write, 3 versions is already alot. It took Microsoft 3 tries for Windows, and they got it on the third try. I haven't been as lucky yet, however none of my projects have been publically released</p>
<p>SNU 3 has a chance, maybe even SNU 1 if Google can give me my website back already. It just won't let me download it</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 18</H1>
<p>I am really happy with the complete makeover of the start page yesterday. It looks great. Today, I re-implemented some older SNU features such as gilding, achievements, and leveling up. I also did a little maintenance to the Valve legends page</p>
<p>I have finally started taking snapshots of separate files on these builds. I should have done this sooner. Now I can make updates to pages separately without copying over the entire directory, which is over 15 gigabytes, and that is not an option anymore due to the space required for frequent backups</p>
<p>Snapshots are now another new way to view older versions of a page, while keeping the modern page in-tact</p>
<p>I went to test Google sites downloading again today. I downloaded the old, old SNU, but not the version 1. Still waiting on that. At least we have SNU 0.1 now</p>

<p>Not much of an update today. Today is the last day of my 6 day break. I added a few features such as the cookie jar, and upload center</p>
<p>There is now full access to SNU 0 but it doesn't feel like much. Just a bunch of extra HTML work for nothing. Hopefully people enjoy it</p>
<p>I was going to make a tribute to Pie-Pivot-o, a YouTuber who died a couple days ago due to suicide, but I just didn't have the time</p>
<p>I updated the HTML references so that they easier for me and other developers to access. There is now a 2 way system to the resources and it works pretty well</p>

<p>I did some work on this site today on the car trip back to Walla Walla. </p>
<p>Mostly, the work I did was for the pie pivot-o archive. I got 20 videos embedded during the car ride</p>
<p>So I have to make a website for my parents apartment. I don't have a server to dedicate to this, and my HTML and web development skills aren't good enough to make this on my local harddrive so for now, I am going to have to make it in Google sites</p>
<p>Once Google allows downloading your modern Google sites websites, it will be all good. This is a mini-project, it shouldn't take long, and it would give me a little exposure</p>
<p>I made a basic demo of the site today, and it works well</p>

<p>User !666 and !Heaven</p>
<p>The 666 user is SNUs personal hell. You can visit it, where I try to make the most demonic scary part of the site. I also made a transition and made SNU heaven, a place with the all-time best content, and links to the fallen creators</p>

<p>SNU is not dead, but it is going to need to be repaired a little bit. I am going to start doing big repairs when I get better at CSS, I am just starting with it. HTML seems easy but CSS really makes it fun. Today, I simply updated the developer and update logs.</p>

<p>These easter eggs are fun to make, and they reward the user with something fun to do. Today, we made a built-in game where you get to beat up hitler with a wide range of weapons and hit locations.</p>
<p>SNU hell is pretty scary, but it can be exciting. SNU hell will also be a place to punish bad accounts and user botting</p>

<p>5G is coming soon, and it will be a great advantage to this site. It will take some time before it becomes mainstream enough that constant use of SNU doesn't begin throttling, or when they make unlimited data, actually unlimuted. Kind of frustrating how all the phone companies adopted that false term</p>
<p>5G will be the only mode that can run SNU 3D and use it smoothly, due to the immense amount of bandwidth required per user (constant 2 Gigabit per second per user) SNU 2D will load at its best in 5G, and for 1D mode, 3G, 4G, and 5G are overkill</p>
<p>Today, I got no progress on the site, I was working on a Factorial Machine for my calculator, and I managed to perfect it to its limits. Development on SNU will continue tomorrow.</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log week 5</H1>
<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 29</H2>
<p>Today is the last day of February 2019, but SNU development is currently dead. I am working on another project, and it used all my time. I have also been slacking off a lot lately, trying to process what CSS will do</p>
<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 28th 2019</p>
<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 30</H2>
<p>I went inactive for a few days. Really sorry about that. I am not going to let this version of SNU die that easily though. I began working on the web app version of my calculator as practice for my introduction to CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets) and I forgot about SNU for a while</p>
<p>SNU is not dead, but it is going to need to be repaired a little bit. I am going to start doing big repairs when I get better at CSS, I am just starting with it. HTML seems easy but CSS really makes it fun. Today, I simply updated the developer and update logs.</p>
<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on March 1st 2019</p>
<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 31</H2>
<p>Today was a slower day. I was having issues with my projects today and issues focusing. I still got some new features into SNU today, such as a log of easter eggs, and features, updates to many pages, and updated to the developer log. And that is about it.</p>
<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on March 2nd 2019</p>
<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 32</H2>
<p>Since I have to go back to school tomorrow, I go to bed earlier. Today, I did a minimal update, adding an archive for Filthy Frank, and doing an overhaul on SNU hell, with torture rooms, cursed images, and scary stories</p>
<p>These easter eggs are fun to make, and they reward the user with something fun to do. Today, we made a built-in game where you get to beat up hitler with a wide range of weapons and hit locations.</p>
<p>SNU hell is pretty scary, but it can be exciting. SNU hell will also be a place to punish bad accounts and user botting</p>
<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 33</H2>
<p>5G is coming soon, and it will be a great advantage to this site. It will take some time before it becomes mainstream enough that constant use of SNU doesn't begin throttling, or when they make unlimited data, actually unlimuted. Kind of frustrating how all the phone companies adopted that false term</p>
<p>5G will be the only mode that can run SNU 3D and use it smoothly, due to the immense amount of bandwidth required per user (constant 2 Gigabit per second per user) SNU 2D will load at its best in 5G, and for 1D mode, 3G, 4G, and 5G are overkill</p>
<p>Today, I got no progress on the site, I was working on a Factorial Machine for my calculator, and I managed to perfect it to its limits. Development on SNU will continue tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on March 4th 2019</p>
<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 34</H2>
<p>Today was a slight comeback day. I did some work on my calculator, and some work on SNU, not much, but it is still progress</p>
<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on March 5th 2019</p>
<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 35</H2>
<p>Nothing happened today. I am having issues with time and my medication, but I will pull through</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 36</H1>
<p>Not much happened today. I made some minor changes, and some HTTP error screens such as 404 and 403. For some reason, adding rhese errors make the site seem more official to me, even though I really dislike 404s on a web server. I don't like stuff going away forever.</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 37</H1>
<p>I am on new medication, and my projects are at a more even state, so hopefully I can work on SNU better today. However, I have other projects first - 6:11 am</p>
<p>By 12:38 pm, I have gotten significant progress on the site, mainly working on status codes and geo-blocking, along with tags, definitions, and snapshots. I have made significant progress today, but now I need a break</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 38</H1>
<p>Yesterday was a really productive day. Today wasn't. I was really hyper today, and had a lack of focus on different projects. I wasn't able to do anything to SNU today. So I have also grown a new hobby, bookmarks. This is a small hobby, I am making a very organized bookmarks file system in Firefox to help me organizr tabs better. This list will be updated and added to SNU every day a change is made. </a>
<p>This hobby should not replace SNU</p>
<p>Later in the day, I hit a limit, then surpassed it with bookmarks and separaters. I thought there was a limit, but I just made an error. However just today, the number of bookmarks and separaters over doubled with my bookmark archive and I didn't get much done with SNU except for a basic stylesheet on the start page, archive updates, and writing to the blog</p>
<p>Today could have been a lot better, hopefully my excitement with bookmarks will go down soon</p>

<p>My bookmark project reached its first issue this morning. I found out that there is a limit on dividers. Hopefully there isn't a limit on folders and bookmarks as well</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 41</H1>
<p>Development hasn't been going that well lately. The Filthy Frank tribute is also going to be reset, as I found a master archive with all his videos, and I can't apply it right now as I need to conserve memory better.</p>
<p>I have also been developing SNU mostly in English. I need to make it available to other languages, but I don't have any secondary languages I am good at, and I cannot rely on Google translate.</p>
<p>So I am going to have to work on smaller features, by the kilobyte, NOT THE MEGABYTE OR GIGABYTE.</p>
<p>One of my new ideas this morning is personal pages for peoples pets. This will require some moderation, but wouldn't it be nice to be able to create a separate account specially designed for animals?</p>
<p>There are a lot of projects I am working on right now and it is going to correlate to SNU very well. There are a few features in beta right now:</p>
<p>Password generator [Python] current version: 1.04</p>
<b>A password generator that allows for intricate password generation from 9 to 256 characters</b>
<p>WebShapes3D [Java] current version: 1.00</p>
<b>A 3D environment for 3D animations and objects on SNU</b>
<p>Today, I applied some minor updates. Development should continue again normally soon</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 42</H1>
<p>I have had a large influx of ideas for SNU today, and I am trying to implement as many as possible. I have been really productive lately, except for a severe laptop issue that has happened for the second time: it randomly deep froze. The only way to stop the freeze was to shut down</p>
<p>I don't know what is causing it, but I do NOT want to have to go get a fourth/fifth laptop this year, the other 2 I had were returned because they overheated and shut down within 5 minutes of bootup.</p>
<p>Due to my new experience in JavaScript, I might start development on the 3D side of SNU pretty soon, if I can get better experience in CSS and JS.</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 43</H1>
<p>Today, I created event pages for the world wide webs 30th anniversary (2 days late) and Pi-day, along with other changes. Development is going at normal speed right now</p>
<p>I spotted an issue with the website today: the front page of 2D mode has some lag to it. It is just loading off a hard drive right now, not even connected to the internet, and I don't know what is causing the lag. There aren't ANY videos on the page, the document file size is less than 40 kilobytes, it has a solid background, not an excessive amount of tezt, some images, and animations, hyperlinks, and that is pretty much it.</p>
<p>I need to fix this issue before it gets worse, but I don't know how.</p>

<p>SNU development will continue, this Tetris project should give me better experience for how I want to style SNU's graphics.</p>
<p>Orher than that, I pretty much took the day off, worked on my Scratch project archive, watched videos, worked on bookmarks, and took time off.</p>
<p>There have been some pretty great development days this week and I am going to stick by them, and work on improvements over time peacefully.</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 50</H1>
<p>Today is my 18th birthday! Unfortunately, it is a school day, so I am going to have a shorter party. I got some work done on SNU, it is coming along great now! I am upgrading the sidebar CSS and it makes the sidebar perfect! Once I get the sidebar to a point where I like it enough, and it works correspondingly with the top navigation bar, I will consider adding sidebars to all pages. Each page will have its own unique sidebar.</p>
<p>Today wasn't the day for my bookmark system though, however that is just a small hobby. Mini updates went around SNU today, with snapshots for multiple pages, and documentation upgrades. Today was pretty good.</p>
<p>So lately I have been thinking about what I should use as a domain name for SNU. www.snu.net would be a difficult name to get, but it would make it extremely easy for people to access the site. www.socialnetworkultimate.net or www.social-network-ultimate.net seem a little long, and I don't know how much I am going to have to spend to get the domain "snu" its just a domain name, but it can make a big difference.</p>
<p>This site is still years from being ready for launch, so I have time.</p>

<p>Today was a stressful day in development. A LOT of time was put into making a translation page for the start page, where people can contribute more languages to SNU. I really want SNU to be available in more languages, not just English, but this document is taking forever to write. The translator itself is larger than the original page, and I am not even halfway done yet.</p>
<p>Other than that, I needed a break, so I worked on the update log and template account blogs. I hope to move to a more exciting project again soon.</p>

<p>So the Article 13 from the European Union is up for debate again, however I really doubt it is going to pass. There is already so much hate for it, and it seems like mainly only Germany is supporting it, so I don't see it passing. If it ever does pass, there will be a revolution. I honestly don't know why they keep trying with this.</p>
<p>Even if it does pass, I will continue to work on SNU, as I hope to finish it some day. Today was a decent day for development. I made a few changes, and increased language support (except people are going to need to translate it) the translation form for 2DStart is ready. All I need now is someone who can speak English and another language fluentlu and is willing to take the time to help translate each snapshot</p>
<p>For the SNU translations for the 2D start page, I got significant progress today, adding support for up to 104 languages (when translated). It took hours, but it will be worth it when the whole world can enjoy SNU.</p>
