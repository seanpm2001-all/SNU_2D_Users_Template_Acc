SNU 3.0 Developer log day 8
Today is the first day of the second week of development. Honestly, I think these burnout periods I am experiencing are actually helpful, as it spans out more time for me to implent and think of new ideas and ways to shape SNU into the way I want it to be
This is just the very tip of the iceberg, but this site has so much potential
Today, I worked on hyperlinks through multiple files and setting up "index bases" in the SNU 2 folders so SNU 3 can have easy access to the legacy version
