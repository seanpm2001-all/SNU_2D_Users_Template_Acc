	<p>On my short walk to class yesterday, I thought of a new idea: 2 positives for 1 negative is a very broken system. The percentages wouldnâ€™t be equal enough, and it would be difficult to decide the exact percentage.</p>
	<p>3 positives to 1 negative is better, as the positives would be 75% and the negative would be the other 25% it would also work well as 1-4  (1-9) 1-19 1-24 1-49 1-99.</p>
	<p>Conclusion: Be more positive</p>
	<p>TL:DR: More positives makes easier math</p>

	<p>Yes,<wbr> I<wbr> know<wbr> Minecraft<wbr> isn't<wbr> as<wbr> popular<wbr> as<wbr> it<wbr> once<wbr> was<wbr>, but<wbr> it<wbr> was<wbr> a<wbr> huge<wbr> part<wbr> of<wbr> my<wbr> childhood<wbr> up<wbr> until<wbr> the<wbr> day<wbr> that<wbr> I<wbr> lost<wbr> all<wbr> my<wbr> progress.<wbr> I<wbr> don't<wbr> know<wbr> what<wbr> happened,<wbr> my<wbr> account<wbr> was<wbr> unable<wbr> to<wbr> sign<wbr> in<wbr>, and<wbr> the<wbr> launcher<wbr> had<wbr> errors.<wbr> Keep<wbr> in<wbr> mind,<wbr> at<wbr> the<wbr> time<wbr> I<wbr> was<wbr> still<wbr> using<wbr> Minecraft<wbr> 1.8,<wbr> waiting<wbr> for<wbr> 1.9<wbr> to<wbr> come<wbr> out,<wbr> a<wbr> pretty<wbr> long<wbr> time<wbr> ago.</p>
	<p>When it crashed, I was in shock. I didn't think too much of it. Every time I tried to go near it again, I had issues. Lately, as of March 2019, I am really getting into it again, almost 3 full years later. I am determined to not give up now. I have the worlds still in memory (in my brain) and I am considering remaking all of the worlds.</p>
	<p>There are a few requirements first:</p>
	<p>â€¢ <b><i>Wait for Windows 8 to go out of support in 2025 (I thought it was already dead years ago until I looked it up today.)</i></b></p>
	<p>â€¢ <b><i>Obtain a copy of Minecraft 1.8</i></b></p>
	<p>â€¢ <b><i>Get better virtual machine knowledge and support (shared folders, prevent corruption from no usage (my machines randomly got corrupted one day and I don't know why) learn how to export to other machines)</i></b></p>
	<p>I really hope I can do this. It might take me a very long time to do this, as I don't have as much free time anymore. It would be really nice to have everything back again! Thanks to RTGame for the videos that have peaked my interest in trying again.</p>

	<p>Development on SNU has lasted for 2 months now, and it has changed my life behind the scenes. I have put in hours upon hours of effort into SNU, on a daily basis. I have dropped certain activities and projects, and I have learned a lot from it.</p>
	<p>One of the first things that had to go was my gaming. I haven't played games on my phone in a long time now, and I used to play everyday for almost a whole year.</p>
	<p>It has also changed the way I work and gave me a great taste of web design. Thanks to W3schools, I have achieved a very good level of HTML knowledge, and it is a very helpful reference.</p>
	<p>This site still has a long ways to go, and I enjoy the experience it has given me.</p>

	<p>While developing SNU, I used special characters. They made the site look better in ways. However, there was a limit between special characters and Emojis. Eventually, I started placing Emojis next to titles of sections, and it made it look more lively.</p>
	<p>Emojis get lost in translation. I am going to keep the original text there, as it would be difficult to figure out what it was with just Emojis, and it would be unprofessional.</p>
	<p>I mainly use Emojis on the sidebars of my website, however that could change. Using them has made me like them more. It is better than black, white, and grey characters in the right situations.</p>

	<p>Most sites don't let you control what ads you see without paying for premium... that is unless you use an adblock. However, SNU is different. SNU lets you control what ads you see. If a specific ad or type of ad bothers you, you can just turn it off via ad settings</p>
	<p>You can't turn ads off completely though, as ads are a way to support the site. We have decided to punish people who use adblock on SNU. If you have your content monetized, you will lose 1 cent of revenue for every ad that is blocked. Make sure to whitelist our site.</p>

	<summary><H1 id="PLANS_FOR_SNU_M3V6">Plans for SNU 3.0 Version 6</H1></summary>
	<p>SNU is going to get a major update on June 14th 2019. Milestone 6 is going to be released, and I am planning an overhaul on how the framework is designed. All the original media from Version 5 will stay, but it will be organized better.</p>
	<p>For example, images, video, audio, documents, and programs will be placed in different sections, while the main HTML will reach out to them. This organization is neccesary, as this site is pretty unorganized at the moment.</p>
	<p>Snapshot builds will be placed in new folders as well, but at the cost of this, links to older snapshots before the update will no longer work.</p>
	<p>I am saving this for version 6, as it will take a while to implement, and summer break will start by then. This update should make the site faster, and more easily accessible. M3V5 will still remain in the SNU old section, and will be linked to M3V6</p>
	<p>Stylesheets will also be placed in their own folders, and throughout the 4 months from June 14th 2019 to October 14th 2019, there will be a similar update schedule as version 5.</p>
	<p>Version 7 will be released on October 14th 2019, but currently that is too far away to talk about now, as there will be tens of thousands of changes to SNU within the next 6 months.</p>

	<p>Yesterday, I had a few scares with advertisements and popups. I have had a solution for a while, and these recent events reminded me of it.</p>
	<p>When ads are implemented, there will be a layer of security for ads. If you were to accidentally click on one, it wouldn't immediately take you to the ad. There will be a confirmation layer by SNU that the advertiser has no access to.</p>
	<p>This confirmation will prevent ricky clicks as it will warn you what you are getting into. There will be a 2 second delay before the buttons show up, so that you have enough time to react. This is also another step in ditching your adblocker.</p>
	<p>This will also come default in the ad settings</p>

	<p>Yesterday, I decided to start integrating each part of SNU into its own section at a faster and more efficient rate. I am starting with the blog feature. There will be some changes now:</p>
	<p>* The blog editor that was located in the templateaccountblogs folder is now obsolete. You will need to use the official editor (don't worry, all the original contents are still there, you won't get support past version 1.01 for the templateaccountblogs links (which has been removed in modern templateaccountblogs versions)</p>
	<p>* There is now an official homepage for the new SNU blog page. It currently only has 1 post, which gives general information on the feature</p>
	<p>This should NOT be confused with SNU books, which has a different approach</p>

	<summary><H1 id="MY_EXPERIENCE_WITH_NOTEPAD++">My experience with notepad++</H1></summary>
	<p>Notepad++ is my favorite IDE. I have been using it for years, and it works really well. However, there are some issues with it that I have experienced frequently.</p>
	<p>On my second laptop (201?-2019) I used notepad++ freqsuently on my laptop. However, when a document surpassed 360 kilobytes in size, it would be slightly prone to crashing. When it crashes, if you didn't save the file beforehand, or it got stuck saving, unless you kept backup versions, you would lose EVERYTHING. As soon as you reopen notepad++, the file gets overwritten. And it gets worse as the file gets larger. Once it reaches 1 megabyte, crashes can happen very frequently, and you have to backup at almost every update.</p>
	<p>The laptop was a low spec computer, 4 gigabytes of RAM, 512 Gigabytes HDD, with a 1.6 Gigahertz processor. When I finally got a new laptop, I haven't had the issue, until April 11th 2019. After about 20 minutes of use, I went to save a snapshot of a file. I saved the original file, and when I copy and pasted the snapshot and tried to save it, it immediately crashed, and when I came back, it acted like nothing even happened.</p>
	<p>This is alarming, because these crashes become frequent, and I have some big projects I am working on. Due to this, I have to back up SNU a lot more frequently.</p>
	<p>Another very small issue I have is, when I reopen the application, the encoding on all UTF-8 documents reverts to ANSI, and I have to change it back or else I deal with mojibaked text and [SYN] blocks.</p>
	<p>Other than that, it is the best IDE. It has strong support and many features with several programming languages, takes little memory, and is lightweight (less than 5 megabytes for the whole program)</p>
	<p>I hope they can even out the bugs I have in the future.</p>

	<p>The only problem at the moment is I don't know how to whitelist specific file types into a categorized part of the file explorer for uploading. I don't want it to be listed as "all files(.*)" I want it to be like:</p>
 <select name="file_options" size="10" multiple>
  <option value="F">Joint Photographic Exports Group file (.jpg .jpe .jfif .jif .jpeg)</option>
  <option value="F">Portable Network Graphics file (.png, .pns)</option>

	<summary><H1 id="APRIL_13_2019_SECURIY_UPDATE">SNU Security update - Saturday April 13th 2019</H1></summary>
	<p>So there has been a security issue recently that has had no effect on SNU, but I should share:</p>
	<p>I am really careful when I use the internet. I haven't got a virus on my primary computer in a really long time. Recently however, a Trojan spread onto my computer and it was immediately quaratined before it could execute, which means it wasn't even a bad one if even Windows Defender can find it</p>
	<p>I haven't been on any unusual sites lately, so this caught me off guard. The Trojan was successfully destroyed on Thursday April 11th 2019. It hasn't come back since. It had no effect on my computer, no files were removed or altered.</p>
	<HR>
	<p>Now let's talk about the security of SNU. I have recently took the time to switch to Duck Duck Go on Firefox so now I have a tool to help me check the security of sites, it was an add-on that came with the search engine, and it is pretty good, so I kept it</p>
	<p>At the moment, SNU has not been made public. I have been keeping it private, and I am the soul lone developer for it. I have put over a hundred hours of work into it in the past 2 and a half months. Since it is stored entirely on my hard drive, it doesn't have an HTTPS connection yet, so this rating for encrypted connection isn't there.</p>
	<p>I don't plan on using trackers on my site, I plan on keeping it fair for all users. Everyone here has the right to their privacy. Unlike Facebook and Google, I value the users privacy on my site. However, again, this site hasn't been launched yet, it is just a cluster of HTML documents, CSS spreadsheets, and media files scattered over an offline file system.</p>
	<p>So DDG (Duck Duck Go) can't check for privacy practices. Once the site is running, this grade should rise from a C+ to an A</p>

	<summary><H1 id="NO_FULL_CONTROL_OVER_THE_INTERNET">Why SNU shouldn't dominate the internet</H1></summary>
	<p>Right now on the internet, we are mainly dominated by just a few companies, big examples include Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and some other ones. We plan on going on that list, but we cannot knock out all the competition</p>
	<p>The problem with relying entirely upon a few services is, those services have to have downtime sometimes. AWS and Google dominate most of the internet. When those go down, even for a minute, it can cause issues worldwide.</p>
	<p>There should always be an alternate ready. SNU was originally planned to be an alternate to YouTube, but it turned into an alternate to everything. However, we don't recommend importing your accounts into SNU, and not visit their site anymore.</p>
	<p>SNU is going to go down at times too, whether we want it to or not. Always make sure you have a backup. For this reason, the way SNU will be supporting outside businesses is by linking traffic from SNU to their site. So if you make $0.06 off of SNU, $0.02 of it would go to you, $0.02 of it would be split with the site it is sharing to, and $0.02 of it would be sent to SNU. See? Balanced.</p>
	<p>Other than just internet services, you should be even more prepared. Try buying a computer with a hard drive (not a ChromeBook) where you can download content and save it for offline use. SNU is going to be an alternate for every site, but it should NEVER replace every site. This is why you can download any piece of content off SNU (except for restricted content, like TV shows and movies that are still under copyright protection)</p>
	<p>This is a common occurance nowadays that shouldn't be happening: when the internet goes down, everything stops. Businesses (like hospitals) don't carry hard copies of patient records, so if the internet goes down for even 5 minutes, doctors won't know what to do with the patients, as all their info is stored on a server. Always make sure to keep a hard copy when possible!</p>
	<p>TL;DR: use SNU but also make sure to use other sites, as SNU won't be up 24/7/365, and save a copy of your work offline for later use</p>

	<p>I have found a way to make advertisements even more fair on SNU. This is on the creators end: every 4 cents you make off of ad revenue, the money is split in 4 ways:</p>
	<p>* 1 cent out of the 4 cents goes to the advertiser</p>
	<p>* 1 cent out of the 4 cents goes to the hosted website</p>
	<p>* 1 cent goes to you</p>
	<p>* 1 cent goes to SNU</p>
	<p>This way, we can benefit you, the advertiser, ourselves, and also another website</p>

	<p>Today was a better day in development. So the user profile now has an immense amount of sections, currently totaling at 125. Today was mostly an index update, along with adding settings, and fixing up the blog sections</p>

	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 1</H2>
	<p>Today is the first day of SNU 3 development. Version 2.0 was a failure, as it wasn't possible to work with the code I had, and it had poor planning. Version 3 is already looking really good</p>
	<p>Today, after more HTML testing, I decided that I should try and develop a basic HTML structure for SNU instead of depending on Google sites or Javascript any longer</p>
	<p>It is almost like a sign. The HTML hyperlink error lead to so many discoveries, I began looking up how to do all these different things. Now I have</p>
	<p>After I successfully managed to embed images, audio, and video into HTML, along with other skills like opening files in other folders, hosting downloads, and opening documents within documents, I moved from my HTML testing ground into the real environment</p>
	<p>I am going to try and take it slowly so I don't have to restart again. I think version 3 has a lot of potential. Someday, I will get this site working</p>
	<p>Today, I started out with development on the basic site elements such as pseudocode, front pages, trending, and assets. I laid the foundation today</p>

	<p>Today is another big day in Modern SNU development. I began to work on the profiles for staff and companies. Getting the layout for staff right is important, along with users (coming tomorrow) today, I just established a home base for the sites community</p>

	<p>I have now reached the point with this site where it is as functional as SNU 1. I can legitimately say I am browsing SNU. However, this is just the structure. The fun part comes later. However, I haven't outperformed the original SNU yet, however some of its content is finally over to the new site</p>
	<p>Today, I worked on making alternates to the rich formatting versions of specific pages, increasing documentation, and working on blogs. I got a lot done again today as well. I also updated the site to version 3.04 and added Big Buck Bunny content in. Since I added over 10 gigabytes today, I have decided I will follow a new update schedule:</p>
	<p>I will continue working on the site daily, but I can't make an entirely new version all the time. I can only make a new version every 4 months. This is to conserve the last 490 Gigabytes on my laptops hard drive. This is the way it will be until I get a new computer or a better spot for memory</p>

	<p>After some research, I decided that I need to put a little less focus on customizing menus and such and work on making the foundation for a good algorithm. There are lots of variables and conditions that go into the SNU algorithm, and it is going to take YEARS to implemeent</p>
	<p>I am really hoping I don't have to make another re-write, 3 versions is already alot. It took Microsoft 3 tries for Windows, and they got it on the third try. I haven't been as lucky yet, however none of my projects have been publically released</p>
	<p>SNU 3 has a chance, maybe even SNU 1 if Google can give me my website back already. It just won't let me download it</p>

	<p>I am really happy with the complete makeover of the start page yesterday. It looks great. Today, I re-implemented some older SNU features such as gilding, achievements, and leveling up. I also did a little maintenance to the Valve legends page</p>
	<p>I have finally started taking snapshots of separate files on these builds. I should have done this sooner. Now I can make updates to pages separately without copying over the entire directory, which is over 15 gigabytes, and that is not an option anymore due to the space required for frequent backups</p>
	<p>Snapshots are now another new way to view older versions of a page, while keeping the modern page in-tact</p>
	<p>I went to test Google sites downloading again today. I downloaded the old, old SNU, but not the version 1. Still waiting on that. At least we have SNU 0.1 now</p>

	<p>Not much of an update today. Today is the last day of my 6 day break. I added a few features such as the cookie jar, and upload center</p>
	<p>There is now full access to SNU 0 but it doesn't feel like much. Just a bunch of extra HTML work for nothing. Hopefully people enjoy it</p>
	<p>I was going to make a tribute to Pie-Pivot-o, a YouTuber who died a couple days ago due to suicide, but I just didn't have the time</p>
	<p>I updated the HTML references so that they easier for me and other developers to access. There is now a 2 way system to the resources and it works pretty well</p>

	<p>Other than that, not much else was done to the site today. I updated the update log, and worked a little on the blog section but that is pretty much it.</p>

	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 15</H2>
	<p>I have now reached the point with this site where it is as functional as SNU 1. I can legitimately say I am browsing SNU. However, this is just the structure. The fun part comes later. However, I haven't outperformed the original SNU yet, however some of its content is finally over to the new site</p>
	<p>Today, I worked on making alternates to the rich formatting versions of specific pages, increasing documentation, and working on blogs. I got a lot done again today as well. I also updated the site to version 3.04 and added Big Buck Bunny content in. Since I added over 10 gigabytes today, I have decided I will follow a new update schedule:</p>
	<p>I will continue working on the site daily, but I can't make an entirely new version all the time. I can only make a new version every 4 months. This is to conserve the last 490 Gigabytes on my laptops hard drive. This is the way it will be until I get a new computer or a better spot for memory</p>
	<P>It's valentines day today btw</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 14th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 16</H2>
	<p>Today was a pretty good day in development. I was able to do a lot. I added a home page for the game FaÃ§ade, and I actually made a working update log that is up to date. I got burnt out really bad at the end, hopefully tomorrow is better</p>
	<p>There are just so many files, it is getting hard to manage, and folder switching is difficult too due to HTML limitations</p>
	<p>I got a temporary burn-out on the project for the first time in 4 days, I just need a small break</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 15th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 17</H2>
	<p>After some research, I decided that I need to put a little less focus on customizing menus and such and work on making the foundation for a good algorithm. There are lots of variables and conditions that go into the SNU algorithm, and it is going to take YEARS to implemeent</p>
	<p>I am really hoping I don't have to make another re-write, 3 versions is already alot. It took Microsoft 3 tries for Windows, and they got it on the third try. I haven't been as lucky yet, however none of my projects have been publically released</p>
	<p>SNU 3 has a chance, maybe even SNU 1 if Google can give me my website back already. It just won't let me download it</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 16th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 18</H2>
	<p>I am really happy with the complete makeover of the start page yesterday. It looks great. Today, I re-implemented some older SNU features such as gilding, achievements, and leveling up. I also did a little maintenance to the Valve legends page</p>
	<p>I have finally started taking snapshots of separate files on these builds. I should have done this sooner. Now I can make updates to pages separately without copying over the entire directory, which is over 15 gigabytes, and that is not an option anymore due to the space required for frequent backups</p>
	<p>Snapshots are now another new way to view older versions of a page, while keeping the modern page in-tact</p>
	<p>I went to test Google sites downloading again today. I downloaded the old, old SNU, but not the version 1. Still waiting on that. At least we have SNU 0.1 now</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 17th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 19</H2>
	<p>Not much of an update today. Today is the last day of my 6 day break. I added a few features such as the cookie jar, and upload center</p>
	<p>There is now full access to SNU 0 but it doesn't feel like much. Just a bunch of extra HTML work for nothing. Hopefully people enjoy it</p>
	<p>I was going to make a tribute to Pie-Pivot-o, a YouTuber who died a couple days ago due to suicide, but I just didn't have the time</p>
	<p>I updated the HTML references so that they easier for me and other developers to access. There is now a 2 way system to the resources and it works pretty well</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 18th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 20</H2>
	<p>Pretty slow development day today. I have been working on an HTML reference document collection so I can choose page colors easier. It is a big and unique index with lots of beautiful and exciting colors.</p>
	<p>Other than that, not much else was done to the site today. I updated the update log, and worked a little on the blog section but that is pretty much it.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 19th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 21</H2>
	<p>I had the day off from school today, since it wouldn't be worth going in only to have 20 minute classes. 2 Hour delays on a Wednesday shortened schedule is a no</p>
	<p>I was going to try and add content to this site today and make a huge update, but instead, I got distracted with a big video project, schoolwork, and some time on YouTube and reddit</p>
	<p>However, I was able to start making the tribute to a recent YouTuber who died, Pie Pivot-o.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do much today</p>

	<p>A small update today, but a little bigger than yesterday's. I have a lot of ideas, but I cannot implement all of them today. Tomorrow I go on a trip to Spokane, so there could either be more development time if I am comfortable enough to work in the truck, or less if I can't access the site, or have to use it in the hotel</p>
	<p>The Pie Pivot-o tribute is coming along slowly, but it will be worth it in the end, as it will be a beacon to celebrate his life and all he has done on the internet. It's still really sad that he lost his life so early</p>

	<p>I am back from my vacation. I have some updates</p>
	<p>I did some work on this site today on the car trip back to Walla Walla. </p>
	<p>Mostly, the work I did was for the pie pivot-o archive. I got 20 videos embedded during the car ride</p>
	<p>So I have to make a website for my parents apartment. I don't have a server to dedicate to this, and my HTML and web development skills aren't good enough to make this on my local harddrive so for now, I am going to have to make it in Google sites</p>
	<p>Once Google allows downloading your modern Google sites websites, it will be all good. This is a mini-project, it shouldn't take long, and it would give me a little exposure</p>
	<p>I made a basic demo of the site today, and it works well</p>

	<p>Today was an easy day for this project. I haven't been feeling that good, a lot of anxiery pain. So I finished up the Pie Pivot-o Tribute by adding all video descriptions, and his opinion on CharmX, and I also added 2 new features to SNU:</p>
	<p>User !666 and !Heaven</p>
	<p>The 666 user is SNUs personal hell. You can visit it, where I try to make the most demonic scary part of the site. I also made a transition and made SNU heaven, a place with the all-time best content, and links to the fallen creators</p>
	<p>I did some updates to the update log and the developer log, and that is pretty much it.</p>

	<p>I am really glad I introduced the new snapshot system into this SNU project. Recently this morning, there was a severe system crash. My computer froze for over 20 minutes, and I lost 20 minutes worth of work on a new build on a different project</p>

	<p>SNU is not dead, but it is going to need to be repaired a little bit. I am going to start doing big repairs when I get better at CSS, I am just starting with it. HTML seems easy but CSS really makes it fun. Today, I simply updated the developer and update logs.</p>

	<p>Not much happened today. I made some minor changes, and some HTTP error screens such as 404 and 403. For some reason, adding rhese errors make the site seem more official to me, even though I really dislike 404s on a web server. I don't like stuff going away forever.</p>

	<p>I am on new medication, and my projects are at a more even state, so hopefully I can work on SNU better today. However, I have other projects first - 6:11 am</p>
	<p>By 12:38 pm, I have gotten significant progress on the site, mainly working on status codes and geo-blocking, along with tags, definitions, and snapshots. I have made significant progress today, but now I need a break</p>

	<p>Yesterday was a really productive day. Today wasn't. I was really hyper today, and had a lack of focus on different projects. I wasn't able to do anything to SNU today. So I have also grown a new hobby, bookmarks. This is a small hobby, I am making a very organized bookmarks file system in Firefox to help me organizr tabs better. This list will be updated and added to SNU every day a change is made. </a>
	<p>This hobby should not replace SNU</p>
	<p>Later in the day, I hit a limit, then surpassed it with bookmarks and separaters. I thought there was a limit, but I just made an error. However just today, the number of bookmarks and separaters over doubled with my bookmark archive and I didn't get much done with SNU except for a basic stylesheet on the start page, archive updates, and writing to the blog</p>
	<p>Today could have been a lot better, hopefully my excitement with bookmarks will go down soon</p>

	<p>Development hasn't been going that well lately. The Filthy Frank tribute is also going to be reset, as I found a master archive with all his videos, and I can't apply it right now as I need to conserve memory better.</p>
	<p>I have also been developing SNU mostly in English. I need to make it available to other languages, but I don't have any secondary languages I am good at, and I cannot rely on Google translate.</p>
	<p>So I am going to have to work on smaller features, by the kilobyte, NOT THE MEGABYTE OR GIGABYTE.</p>
	<p>One of my new ideas this morning is personal pages for peoples pets. This will require some moderation, but wouldn't it be nice to be able to create a separate account specially designed for animals?</p>
	<p>There are a lot of projects I am working on right now and it is going to correlate to SNU very well. There are a few features in beta right now:</p>
	<p>Password generator [Python] current version: 1.04</p>
	<b>A password generator that allows for intricate password generation from 9 to 256 characters</b>
	<p>WebShapes3D [Java] current version: 1.00</p>
	<b>A 3D environment for 3D animations and objects on SNU</b>
	<p>Today, I applied some minor updates. Development should continue again normally soon</p>

	<p>I have had a large influx of ideas for SNU today, and I am trying to implement as many as possible. I have been really productive lately, except for a severe laptop issue that has happened for the second time: it randomly deep froze. The only way to stop the freeze was to shut down</p>
	<p>I don't know what is causing it, but I do NOT want to have to go get a fourth/fifth laptop this year, the other 2 I had were returned because they overheated and shut down within 5 minutes of bootup.</p>

	<p>Not much happened today. I made some minor changes, and some HTTP error screens such as 404 and 403. For some reason, adding rhese errors make the site seem more official to me, even though I really dislike 404s on a web server. I don't like stuff going away forever.</p>

	<p>Today, I created event pages for the world wide webs 30th anniversary (2 days late) and Pi-day, along with other changes. Development is going at normal speed right now</p>
	<p>I spotted an issue with the website today: the front page of 2D mode has some lag to it. It is just loading off a hard drive right now, not even connected to the internet, and I don't know what is causing the lag. There aren't ANY videos on the page, the document file size is less than 40 kilobytes, it has a solid background, not an excessive amount of tezt, some images, and animations, hyperlinks, and that is pretty much it.</p>
	<p>I need to fix this issue before it gets worse, but I don't know how.</p>

	<p>Orher than that, I pretty much took the day off, worked on my Scratch project archive, watched videos, worked on bookmarks, and took time off.</p>

	<p>Today is my 18th birthday! Unfortunately, it is a school day, so I am going to have a shorter party. I got some work done on SNU, it is coming along great now! I am upgrading the sidebar CSS and it makes the sidebar perfect! Once I get the sidebar to a point where I like it enough, and it works correspondingly with the top navigation bar, I will consider adding sidebars to all pages. Each page will have its own unique sidebar.</p>
	<p>Today wasn't the day for my bookmark system though, however that is just a small hobby. Mini updates went around SNU today, with snapshots for multiple pages, and documentation upgrades. Today was pretty good.</p>
	<p>So lately I have been thinking about what I should use as a domain name for SNU. www.snu.net would be a difficult name to get, but it would make it extremely easy for people to access the site. www.socialnetworkultimate.net or www.social-network-ultimate.net seem a little long, and I don't know how much I am going to have to spend to get the domain "snu" its just a domain name, but it can make a big difference.</p>
	<p>This site is still years from being ready for launch, so I have time.</p>

	<p>Today was a stressful day in development. A LOT of time was put into making a translation page for the start page, where people can contribute more languages to SNU. I really want SNU to be available in more languages, not just English, but this document is taking forever to write. The translator itself is larger than the original page, and I am not even halfway done yet.</p>
	<p>Other than that, I needed a break, so I worked on the update log and template account blogs. I hope to move to a more exciting project again soon.</p>

	<p>So the Article 13 from the European Union is up for debate again, however I really doubt it is going to pass. There is already so much hate for it, and it seems like mainly only Germany is supporting it, so I don't see it passing. If it ever does pass, there will be a revolution. I honestly don't know why they keep trying with this.</p>
	<p>Even if it does pass, I will continue to work on SNU, as I hope to finish it some day. Today was a decent day for development. I made a few changes, and increased language support (except people are going to need to translate it) the translation form for 2DStart is ready. All I need now is someone who can speak English and another language fluentlu and is willing to take the time to help translate each snapshot</p>
	<p>For the SNU translations for the 2D start page, I got significant progress today, adding support for up to 104 languages (when translated). It took hours, but it will be worth it when the whole world can enjoy SNU.</p>

	<p>Today, I added back the Dmail client. It was originally going to be a separate project from SNU, but it really fits here. I had to search my hard drives for over 20 minutes to find the original pictures. Luckily I found them. DMail has been added today, along with some other fixes.</p>

	<p>There was significant progressd on the documentation for Dmail today, with several new snapshots, lists, and upgrades to existing features. It is getting closer to being the first rough draft.</p>

	<P>So my prediction on Article 13 was wrong. They actually passed it. I didn't want to have to do this, but I am now applying a full-on ban for ANYONE in the European Union from accessing my site until Article 13 is repealed. Hopefully they repeal it by the time my site launches, or it is really going to suck for them.</p>
	<p>Today, I applied notices about that, and worked on a new virtual machine player.</p>

	<p>I had a lot of other projects today and less time than usual, so I didn't get as much done. Very sorry about that.</p>
	<p>However, later in the day, I was able to do a more major update, and add in better virtualization features, along with overall site documentation updates. Today wasn't a complete failure for this project.</p>

	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 50</H2>
	<p>Today is my 18th birthday! Unfortunately, it is a school day, so I am going to have a shorter party. I got some work done on SNU, it is coming along great now! I am upgrading the sidebar CSS and it makes the sidebar perfect! Once I get the sidebar to a point where I like it enough, and it works correspondingly with the top navigation bar, I will consider adding sidebars to all pages. Each page will have its own unique sidebar.</p>
	<p>Today wasn't the day for my bookmark system though, however that is just a small hobby. Mini updates went around SNU today, with snapshots for multiple pages, and documentation upgrades. Today was pretty good.</p>
	<p>So lately I have been thinking about what I should use as a domain name for SNU. www.snu.net would be a difficult name to get, but it would make it extremely easy for people to access the site. www.socialnetworkultimate.net or www.social-network-ultimate.net seem a little long, and I don't know how much I am going to have to spend to get the domain "snu" its just a domain name, but it can make a big difference.</p>
	<p>This site is still years from being ready for launch, so I have time.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on March 21st 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 51</H2>
	<p>Today was a stressful day in development. A LOT of time was put into making a translation page for the start page, where people can contribute more languages to SNU. I really want SNU to be available in more languages, not just English, but this document is taking forever to write. The translator itself is larger than the original page, and I am not even halfway done yet.</p>
	<p>Other than that, I needed a break, so I worked on the update log and template account blogs. I hope to move to a more exciting project again soon.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on March 22nd 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 52</H2>
	<p>So the Article 13 from the European Union is up for debate again, however I really doubt it is going to pass. There is already so much hate for it, and it seems like mainly only Germany is supporting it, so I don't see it passing. If it ever does pass, there will be a revolution. I honestly don't know why they keep trying with this.</p>
	<p>Even if it does pass, I will continue to work on SNU, as I hope to finish it some day. Today was a decent day for development. I made a few changes, and increased language support (except people are going to need to translate it) the translation form for 2DStart is ready. All I need now is someone who can speak English and another language fluentlu and is willing to take the time to help translate each snapshot</p>
	<p>For the SNU translations for the 2D start page, I got significant progress today, adding support for up to 104 languages (when translated). It took hours, but it will be worth it when the whole world can enjoy SNU.</p>

	<p>For now, most of the new style is being placed on the blog page for templateaccount, which is my testing account for what an account should be styled like. Today, I also added new support to the virtual machine system, and updated other pages to keep the site up to date.</p>
	<p>My spring break finally starts tomorrow, and I will be able to get a lot more done.</p>

	<p>Today was an evaluation day. Nothing much happened to SNU. Plus today is the first day of Spring break. I needed a little break. I am starting development on my calculator again. I am evaluating on things like:</p>
	<p><i><b> â€¢ How I should manage my projects</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b> â€¢ Worker goals</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b> â€¢ How I am going to operate the calculator (if I should use custom functions or not)</b></i></p>
	<p>I also took today as a break. I focused on smaller projects only, all I did for SNU today was update the developer log, and update log.</p>

	<p>Today wasn't the best day for development, however not many of the main features are being implemented.</p>
	<p>One thing I like about April fools day, is that I get to see peoples creative and comedic approaches to making a fool out of someone.</p>
	<p>Also, due to time zones, some people upload their April fools day jokes on April 1st in their time zone, but March 31st in other timezones. For this reason, it is still considered April fools day on March 31st for some time zones, and April 1st for other time zones</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, I didn't have any April fools day ideas for the site this year, so you can accept the one from yesterday. I have also decided to bring in another feature to SNU, a map of the universe. Like Google Earth, but universal, more interactive, and more advanced.</p>
	<p>It will be available strictly in 3D mode, and you will be able to see not only Earth, but the moon, Mars, the sun, even past the Milky Way Galaxy. This is a future idea, and it is going to take insane amount of memory in a standard 3 years from today.</p>
	<p>I hope someday I can work together with NASA, and other space organizations to increase the functionality of the universal map, and get new data for it.</p>

	<p>Today, I got a lot done. I sat down and worked for over 2 hours this morning. I added in lots of new features, such as ad settings, where you can manage what ads you see, a big update to the dashboard, finishing up the colored text in the HTML master sheet, and brief documentation.</p>
	<p>I have other things to do today, hopefully I can come back to developing SNU again later.</p>

	<p>Today was a dark day outside, lack of sunlight can be depressing. I didn't have much planned for SNU today, so I did minimal updates. I am predicting this, but if we launch SNU universe, Google is going to make Google Mars or a different name/expansion to Google earth.</p>
	<p>I don't have the skills right now to make it, but it is under way within the idea list.</p>
	<p>Today, I had to go search for hate symbols to update the anti-racism engine. SNU will allow these symbols ONLY in educational, historical, and parody purposes, but promoting hate speech on SNU could result in permanent account suspension.</p>
	<p>Later in the day, I started playing games again. I haven't played these games on my phone since February 28th 2019. I didn't have the best time coming back, but I remembered some things that I need to implement into my ad system.</p>

	<p>Today wasn't the best day for development. It is on the decline again. SNU is getting really advanced now, and I am going to have to learn a new language (possibly PHP) and further Javascript and CSS to improve the site more.</p>
	<p>The ad engine is getting really good. Soon I am going to get these options to work. I hope it makes ad creators more diverse, and creative, as that is what this engine promotes: difference. SNU users can choose whatever ads they want, they don't have to deal with bad ads. They are in control of that.</p>
	<p>However, everyone has a different definition on what a bad ad is, that is why they get to set up the ad engine settings to their preference. I really hope people take the time to set up their accounts, as you can get massive benefits while using SNU if done right.</p>
	<p>Today was just a filler day, I did some updates to common features, along with the ad engine.</p>

	<p>So last night I got stressed out, as I realized that wr are getting close to reaching the limit of a silicon chip, and the obsolesence of Moore's law. I am going to have to be more careful with resources, however it shouldn't be too much of an issue, as we have 1 terabyte SD cards that are extremely tiny. We could probably get several petabytes of data in a laptop if we had enough.</p>
	<p>I wonder what the next big thing will be.</p>
	<p>Today, I applied minor updates to SNU, updated pages, and worked on other projects.</p>

	<p>Almost forgot to write in here today: Today was a makeup day with slight new features. I have replaced every long line of equal-signs with a single <:HR> tag ( minus the : ) today, and it has made the page look better, and also take up less space.</p>
	<p>There were a few brief updates today, and I made a big controversial move for the site: limiting ad blocking. There has been a new monetization system put in place today that punishes people who skip ads. Now, when people skip ads, it builds up. They lose their own earnings for every ad that is blocked.</p>
	<p>The system is designed to make it so people who upload content and want money for their content can't be a hypocrite and block ads when viewing other peoples content. When you block too many ads (40000) you lose the ability to monetize your content for 6 months.</p>
	<p>This new rule was put into place to protect the SNU economy once it starts. Keep in mind, I am the only person making and managing this site at the moment. It is a lot of work to do this every day, and eventually I am going to need a team of people. Right now, I am just laying down the foundation and ideas.</p>
	<p>Spring Break is almost over and I have wasted so much time during it, because of medication issues, that I really missed out on doing massive improvements to this site. I still got a lot done, however, just not as much as I could.</p>

	<p>Last night, a big part of the site started development: I am finally putting in the designs. Starting off in the blog section, you will notice that the background isn't a solid color anymore, and the text is white instead of black.</p>
	<p>You will also notice some transparent boxes. This is something I have been trying to add to this page for a while, last night I started with the CSS.</p>

	<p>Spring Break is over, and I went back to 11th grade today. The past 2 days I have made significant progress on the website.</p>
	<p>Today, only a few minor improvements were added. Keep in mind, I am juggling over 5 projects at once, I am unable to put all my time and resources into a single project, I juggle a minimum of 4 projects a day.</p>
	<p>This doesn't mean that the development on SNU is poor. How I have done it, is SNU is required work after all the other projects are done, and I can have flexible periods of time to work on it.</p>
	<p>Sometimes, I have large amounts of time, like Saturday and Sunday, and get lots done, other days, I have little time, and can still put effort into it.</p>
	<p>I am planning out a new update in June and I am excited to roll it out.</p>

	<p>Today was another day of development. Another small update, as I didn't have as much time. Sorry about this, I am just so busy, I can't work on SNU as much as I could</p>
	<p>I am running low on small ideas at the moment, so I am digging through older ones at the moment. One of the older ideas I am introducing is user plans.</p>
	<p>Paying for plans cost money, except for the first 2 (standard, and family) where you can connect up to 20 accounts and manage a network (family plan) or operate as a single user (standard plan)</p>
	<p>The statistics are a work in progress at the moment, and the economy isn't at the point where we can support this yet, it may take several years</p>

	<H2>SNU developer log day 64</H2>
	<p>Today wasn't the best day for development. It is on the decline again. SNU is getting really advanced now, and I am going to have to learn a new language (possibly PHP) and further Javascript and CSS to improve the site more.</p>
	<p>The ad engine is getting really good. Soon I am going to get these options to work. I hope it makes ad creators more diverse, and creative, as that is what this engine promotes: difference. SNU users can choose whatever ads they want, they don't have to deal with bad ads. They are in control of that.</p>
	<p>However, everyone has a different definition on what a bad ad is, that is why they get to set up the ad engine settings to their preference. I really hope people take the time to set up their accounts, as you can get massive benefits while using SNU if done right.</p>
	<p>Today was just a filler day, I did some updates to common features, along with the ad engine.</p>

	<H2>SNU developer log day 65</H2>
	<p>So last night I got stressed out, as I realized that wr are getting close to reaching the limit of a silicon chip, and the obsolesence of Moore's law. I am going to have to be more careful with resources, however it shouldn't be too much of an issue, as we have 1 terabyte SD cards that are extremely tiny. We could probably get several petabytes of data in a laptop if we had enough.</p>
	<p>I wonder what the next big thing will be.</p>
	<p>Today, I applied minor updates to SNU, updated pages, and worked on other projects.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on April 5th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU developer log day 66</H2>
	<p>Almost forgot to write in here today: Today was a makeup day with slight new features. I have replaced every long line of equal-signs with a single <:HR> tag ( minus the : ) today, and it has made the page look better, and also take up less space.</p>
	<p>There were a few brief updates today, and I made a big controversial move for the site: limiting ad blocking. There has been a new monetization system put in place today that punishes people who skip ads. Now, when people skip ads, it builds up. They lose their own earnings for every ad that is blocked.</p>
	<p>The system is designed to make it so people who upload content and want money for their content can't be a hypocrite and block ads when viewing other peoples content. When you block too many ads (40000) you lose the ability to monetize your content for 6 months.</p>
	<p>This new rule was put into place to protect the SNU economy once it starts. Keep in mind, I am the only person making and managing this site at the moment. It is a lot of work to do this every day, and eventually I am going to need a team of people. Right now, I am just laying down the foundation and ideas.</p>
	<p>Spring Break is almost over and I have wasted so much time during it, because of medication issues, that I really missed out on doing massive improvements to this site. I still got a lot done, however, just not as much as I could.</p>
	<p>Thank you for reading! - Sean P. Myrick</p>

	<H2>SNU developer log day 67</H2>
	<p>Last night, a big part of the site started development: I am finally putting in the designs. Starting off in the blog section, you will notice that the background isn't a solid color anymore, and the text is white instead of black.</p>
	<p>You will also notice some transparent boxes. This is something I have been trying to add to this page for a while, last night I started with the CSS.</p>
	<p>Currently, I have the hyperlink section working fully functional, and I tried putting in a transparent box over a < details > tag, but the box overrode the < details > and now the text won't show up.</p>
	<p>This is a new feature, and it is currently being worked on. Once I get the strategy down, it should spread to all other parts of the blog.</p>

	<p>I managed to back up my entire laptop yesterday. It took about 7 hours. During the backup, I contemplated if I should add SNU to it. And I did. Please note: this doesn't mean that version 3.0.6 is out yet, it comes on June 14th 2019</p>
	<p>Today was a more productive day for the site, as I had more time to work on it.</p>

	<p>Today is finally Friday. So at the moment, not much has been added to SNU, I have had some delays this week, such as bookmarks, hard drive backup (which took 7 hours) updates, side projects, downtime, and stress. Not much was added to SNU, but due to the plan to frequently update and bring big features here at a faster rate, development should pick up again soon.</p>
	<p>To reduce work on the new update, new directories are now being sorted and made in the SNU Milestone 3 Version 6 format. When that update comes out, all other folders will be like this. It will be a lot more organized, and easier to access</p>

	<p>Today was a good day for development. It is finally rhe weekend, and I was able to get some work done on this site. So there was a bad description on why I updated the blog editor yesterday: the blog editor in templateaccount is actual just a prototype, and it was integrated into the template account. I needed to change this and make a separate editor for it. The new editor is improved, and is universl around the site, making the prototype seem week</p>
	<p>So I am planning on taking a staff photo some time this year, and there will be a little joke with it: I will be the only one in the picture. Why? So far, I am the only one working on this site. It is both a joke and reality</p>

	<p>Today is the last day of the weekend. My computers processor has been getting hammered by Scratch 3. I am working on archiving all of my older projects, and due to the bloat on Scratch 3, it is using massive amounts of  memory for simple projects, constantly crashing, and it has been a pain for me. It took me over 2 hours to download a little over 20 projects.</p>
	<p>Due to this, I wasn't able to make much progress on SNU today. I applied a basic update, but nothing special. Development is slow right now because there are so many different projects going at once. I hope to fix these flaws soon</p>

	<p>I start school back up again today, but there is a conflict with one of my projects that is going to take away time from SNU. Today, there was a simple update, with small updates, but no big changes.</p>
	<p>However, these small changes added up, and made a decently sized update for today. I am celebrating Earth day a little early this year, and I will continue to celebrate it even after the day passes. This is a really beautiful planet.</p>
	<p>Looking up into the clouds with my glasses on is a crazy feeling. It is over 50000x higher quality than my phones camera [4K] when I look into the sky, it just feels insane. We are lucky to live on a planet as nice as this.</p>
	<p>Please do your part to help preserve this wonderful planet for future generations!</p>
