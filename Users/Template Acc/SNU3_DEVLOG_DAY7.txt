SNU 3.0 Developer log day 7
The first week of development has finished and I have laid a pretty good foundation
I have been getting a lot of progress with new settings, currently, I am working on cloud storage and personalization settings
I also created my first HTML stylesheet today, then I got burnt out as soon as I figured out how to connect a hyperlink
