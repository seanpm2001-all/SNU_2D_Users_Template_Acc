SNU 3.0 Developer log day 11
I haven't been updating the rest account lately. Today, I added in the Febuary 8th, 9th, and 10th days in the blog. I also put more work into the legends of the internet project, and made a new Terms Of Service that is more updated
I took a break for the rest of the day afterwards
