  <p>This was a mini joke right before April 1st in 2019. The joke was that you were expecting to get rick rolled, because it was stated as an unoriginal joke, but in return, you got an even more unoriginal joke: darude sandstorm.</p>
  <p>As soon as you fell for the trap, the song would autoplay and loop while a troll is laughing at you from the right corner.</p>
  <p>You were given options to <a href="MARCHFOOLS2019_FEEDBACK.html">give feedback</a> to the joke, and <a href="trollface01_happyface.jpg">view the background image</a></p>
  <p>You can visit the joke <a href="MARCHFOOLS2019.html">here</a>
