SNU developer log day 462

I have gotten my schedule under order, but procrastination is messing everything up. Today, I was able to put out the same usual update as lately, but each day, it is being done less effectively. Development has been keeping a repetitive pace lately, but I hope to move on to a new project soon. The current project is nearing completion.

There is no need for a bottom description again today, I don't have anything else I can put.
