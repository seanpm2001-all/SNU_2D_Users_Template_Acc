SNU developer log day 416

Today is my 19th birthday. Today, I worked on getting as much done as possible before 3:00 pm so that I could celebrate my birthday without having to think about work as much. I made a little bit of an extended update today in the nearly 2 hours I had, including articles on typography, the usual documentation, an ideaboard update, and work on a new online school system, as there aren't any good online school programs, and we need something other than Google classroom.

I had a decent day with development today. I recently came up with more ideas that I can work with, and I hope to begin improving site development soon. I finally have a good schedule (at least today) and I may become more productive. I also finally found a good Linux laptop, and I might get it as a late birthday present. It took a year of monthly searches, but I think this might be the one. Site development may slow down during the copy over process.

The online school project has been delayed for today. I hope I can work on it tomorrow.

I got a new dog at 3:30 pm today. I am keeping it as a foster pet for 2 months while the Humane Society is under quarantine. It is a really nice dog, and the only reason why people didn't ever adopt it is because of how hard it pulls on its leash. I will work on it every day to try and fix this issue. Along with chasing the dog down the street after someone let go (running over 100 meters at full speed) and my birthday party, I didn't get back to work until past 9:00 pm tonight. Some big pros for the website that came out of presents include a 10 terabyte Western Digital hard drive, and a Wi-Fi antenna so I can get internet access in public again, and so I can have internet speeds faster than 4 MB/s again. I had a good time today, and I have a lot to write about in my journal tonight.
