SNU developer log day 480

I didn't have much time again today, but I tried to put out an update. I improved on another feature in the data manager, adding support for download formats (but not the download itself yet, as SNU has no upload functionality yet) and I updated documentation and the ideaboard. I finally fixed a big issue in Firefox today, I haven't been able to log in or view most websites, I found out a way to bypass it, which is creating new profiles. I found the cause as well: an important file was missing (a .sqlite file that contained the data a lot of sites needed) I have also began wrok on a new small project, which is a parody project. It is a fork of the DuckDuckGo privacy essentials tool that tells you the opposite of what the DDG tool does (example: encrypted connection = bad, site is a major tracking network = good. It gives an opposite rating, and it is made to made fun of companies that harvest data and spy on its users. It is a part time project, and once I get ProtonMail setup, I am considering making a GitHub account for it. I will not be hosting SNU on GitHub, but I need to get myself out there first.

Today was a very short development day, I am getting lots of other projects done, and taking time to relax. I live on a farm, and one of our goats gave birth to twins at 1:30 in the morning today. I have been spending a lot of time outside with my family and the new goats, and less time working. I still managed to get something done though. Today was a decent day for development.
