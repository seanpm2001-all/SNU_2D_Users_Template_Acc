SNU developer log day 465

I did the usual thing with development again today. I have been putting extra time into other projects, but I am having a serious issue with procrastination. I received a new item today: a green screen. I have a plan for it for another project, but I might use it for SNU content at some point.

I am not sure how things are going to go once I complete this big project. Today was an OK day for development. I don't have much else I can say.
