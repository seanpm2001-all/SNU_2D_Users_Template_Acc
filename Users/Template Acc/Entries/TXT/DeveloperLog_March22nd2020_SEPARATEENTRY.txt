SNU developer log day 417

I messed up my schedule, and ended up having less work time today. Some things were held off, but I still did some other things with time that will benefit me and the website, mainly research and freeing up other projects. I started work on a new electronic online school part of the site, as my goal to create a better online school system, so that we can finally ditch Google Classroom after 5 painful years of another part of the Google monopoly. This school system will be privacy oriented, unlike Google products, and like the rest of SNU. I am still piecing together how it will work and feel.

I have also been spending some time with the new dog I am going to foster for the next 2 months. His name is Cobie, and he hasn't been adopted since February, since no-one wants to train him not to pull too hard on his leash. He is a really nice dog, and I enjoy taking care of him. I haven't had a big dog in several years, so it is different than taking care of small dogs. He inspired me to start working on the CompuSmell project again, as he loves sniffing everything, more than any dog I have ever seen. I just don't know yet how it will work. Today, other than the online school project, I just worked on documentation, and that is it for today.
