SNU developer log day 401

I was really stressed out with time limits when finalizing last nights update. I made it a lot easier for myself today because of this. Today, I worked on a normal documentation update, with some improvements to BrowserNose.

I ended up being overloaded with tasks again tonight, as I underestimated how much I needed to do. It is now the weekend, and I plan on going to my friend Michaels house tomorrow. I have some very small plans for tomorrow as a break for the past 2 stressful days.
