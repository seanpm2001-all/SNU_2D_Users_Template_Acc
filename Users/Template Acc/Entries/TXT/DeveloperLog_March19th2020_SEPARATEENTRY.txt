SNU developer log day 414

I created another small update today, putting more work into the suicide prevention center, the translation tool, and the new System directory, which hosts important uncategorized SNU files (at the moment) 1 such file is the sortOrder.css file, which shows info on A-Z Z-A 0-9 9-0 sorting across (coming soon) all languages, and alphabet(a) systems.

I am feeling like everything is way too repetitive lately. I only have so many hours in a day, and I don't feel like I am able to do enough. I am having so much downtime lately due to a horrible schedule and missing medication. I was planning on also working on a side project today, but I didn't have the time. Today, I worked mostly on documentation, there is a lot of documentation compared to new content lately, I am sorry for this, but it must be done. I am keeping a better streak than the last time I tried this (with the exporting and separate blog entries, except this time it is for both the update log and developer log) this process usually only takes about 20 minutes a day for all commits related to separate blog and update log entries. Today was a decent day for development, things should hopefully get better soon.
