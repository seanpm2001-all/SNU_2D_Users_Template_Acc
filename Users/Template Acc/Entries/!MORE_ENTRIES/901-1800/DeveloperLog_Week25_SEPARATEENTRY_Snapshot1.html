	<p lang="en">The next big update is under way. I have found the source of my procrastination issues, and fixed it. I have come up with new ideas on how to make the site even better.</p>
	<p lang="en">I have decided to start updating the 1D and 3D pages on a regular basis, along with the 2D pages. 1D and 2D mode has been neglected for too long. Other changes are coming, along with more improvements</p>
	<p lang="en">My summer break is halfway over, and I finally have the boost I need to get what I wanted done. I am going to try and update the site more frequently now. Hopefully there won't be any documentation only updates for a while</p>
	<p lang="en">Tons of new ideas are being put in place, and I have a lot to do to catch up. Today is the start of it.</p>
	<p lang="en">Also with site ideas, today I am releasing the 3rd in the new streak, and the last really basic one for a while</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on July 18th 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 170</H1>
	<p lang="en">I have done it again, a 3rd day of new development. I have been focusing on many changes, however the key goals are improving 1D and 3D mode, removing dead links, and updating older pages. I am doing really well with this</p>
	<p lang="en">I have been working on the 1D part of the site first. I have finally laid the guidelines for the 1D mode, set limits, and repaired the main pages. The next step is to modernize and add to it. 1D mode is designed for old browsers and very slow internet, and it does not contain any visual media</p>
	<p lang="en">I am still trying to figure out how I am going to work on 3D mode, as I don't have any 3D elements ready yet. There was a little issue with the developer log dates, but I fixed it. The dates were 1 day off. I have also come up with new ways of making the developer log and update log work together better, I will try and start implementing my new fix tomorrow</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I also finalized the future entry transparent box project with the update log, it is up to date for new entries up until June 30th 2020, over 10 months from now. I might start updating it again in December of 2019.</p>
	<p lang="en">The site is going through a lot of changes, but it still isn't to the point where I want it yet. I still seem to be far from that point. Another decent day with development today.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on July 19th 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 171</H2>
	<p lang="en">Today was the 4th day in the wave of new updates. The update log is going to receive even more updates too. I just keep finding new things to improve on. With the developer log, I messed up yesterdays weekly entry, and missed the first 2 days. I got distracted yesterday. I fixed it today.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I managed to work on all 3 dimensional modes of the site at once. 3D mode received some new updates to it, but it doesn't have 3D graphics yet.</p>
	<p lang="en">The developer log is all out of order, and I spent some time trying to fix it. I don't think I am going to go ahead anymore in this page, as it is difficult to keep up. Lots of switching, and changes, but I got it right</p>
	<p lang="en">I also went back and fixed every divider. Today wasn't the best day in development, but it was decent. It sounds like a lot got done from what I said, but in reality, not much happened</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on July 20th 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 172</H2>
	<p lang="en">There has been a pattern when I work with the developer log. I always get confused when working with it. Even doing something with its data seems hard to me for some reason. There is also the stress that I might have messed up on 1 days number</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I started adding links to the developer log in the update log for July, and it was a difficult process. I had to keep going back to check to see if I was doing it right. Luckily, I got it over with for today, but I am going to have to do it for June, May, April, March, and February next.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I also did some other small changes, but I didn't get that much done either. I seem to have found another basic documentation style update with not 1 but 14-15 changes a day. I am hoping to change this. I have gotten some notes ready for next week, but I don't have enough content to spread across the whole week</p>
	<p lang="en">The update log is close to reaching 10000 lines of code, and most of my main pages are over 5000 lines of code. The site is getting big and well documented, but it doesn't have all the required features yet. There is still a long ways to go.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on July 21st 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 173</H2>
	<p lang="en">Today was a big day in development on both current big site projects, codename Minecraft Python Edition, and SNU 3.0.5. I put work into all 3 modes today, however the SNU update was mainly just a documentation update.</p>
	<p lang="en">The update log has become the first written page to reach 10000 lines of code, where it currently sits at 10142 lines. I have been adding in more dividers, and links to the developer log in the update log to improve the 2 pages relationship</p>
	<p lang="en">Adding in entries from the developer log to the update log wasn't as difficult for me today luckily, I didn't have any struggle with it. I have been adding in links 1 month per day. Yesterday, I caught up on July 2019 references, and today I did June 2019 references.</p>
	<p lang="en">Along with that, the 1D developer guidelines file received its 4th update in a row, with more rules, and new content. The idea board got another idea into it, but it wasn't the biggest one today, the version history page got a slight update, the developer log got a daily entry, and the update log received a massive update.</p>
	<p lang="en">Development has been gone today, and I have more plans for this week, so this is just the start.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on July 22nd 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 174</H2>
	<p lang="en">Today was another decent day in development. The update log reached its second milestone in a row, with over 500000 bytes in the pages script, and lots of documentation was increased. I added some new sections, and fixed a May 1st 2019 entry on the developer log.</p>
	<p lang="en">For adding in developer log entries, I find it best to have the developer log running side by side with the blog page for better efficiency. I have been doing lots of critical updates to the update log, which has almost brought it to its perfect form.</p>
	<p lang="en">A website I use (https://www.khanacademy.org) had a design change today that I wasn't happy with. It made the layout a lot worse. I am working on a section that shows different interfaces of various sites, so SNU can handle them, and people can change them back when needed.</p>
	<p lang="en">The most content that has been getting added lately is for the Minecraft recreation I am working on in Python. Note, Minecraft Python Edition is just rhe codename, it will have a different name when it reaches the alpha stage, or when I think of a good enough name.</p>
	<p lang="en">The idea board got updated, along with many other pages. Today was a pretty good day for development.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on July 23rd 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 175</H2>
	<p lang="en">Another big update today, but the majority of the update time went to Minecraft Python Edition again. I have worked really hard on getting the update logs full potential this month. I am almost done catching up on referencing developer log entries within it, but I have noticed some issues today.</p>
	<p lang="en">The issues weren't severe, I was able to fix all of them. I am optimizing the transparent content boxes. What I did was remove the second < / details > tag, as it was unneccesary. I also noticed that the April 8th 2019 update had 1 update overlooked. I fixed that, and updated the counters, but the update download page itself is going to need to be updated as well.</p>
	<p lang="en">I got a jump start on todays update as well. Last night, I set up the template entry for tomorrow (today) for the update log.</p>
	<p lang="en">Other than that, it was just another documentation update. I am hoping to work on other updates soon eventually. Maybe when the update log is up to date, I can start doing them again. The update log has gotten so much work that it is a whole new page at this point.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am still finding ways to optimize it too. The whole site is still being optimized, slowly, but efficiently, 1 page at a time.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on July 24th 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 176</H2>
	<p lang="en">I didn't have as much time to develop today due to other projects taking too much time and battery. Luckily, progress was made in a nighttime build that made this a decent update today.</p>
	<p lang="en">I finalized work on update log developer log entries from the 25th of July 2019 to the beginning of 3.0 development. It is now up to date for now, and hopefully now I can get the time to add other features.</p>
	<p lang="en">Lots of time went into Minecraft Python Edition today. A little too much, I used over 3 hours of time on things that werent directly SNU. It seems to be increasing every day this week. Hopefully I can stop it tomorrow.</p>
	<p lang="en">I have some ideas I am going to implement soon, I was hoping that I would be able to do it this week, but it doesn't seem likely right now.</p>
	<p lang="en">Also, the idea streak is halfway done, and only 1 new idea has come up since the latest one that got added today. I am also hoping of eventually integrating a web version of my project, codenamed Minecraft Python Edition into SNU</p>
