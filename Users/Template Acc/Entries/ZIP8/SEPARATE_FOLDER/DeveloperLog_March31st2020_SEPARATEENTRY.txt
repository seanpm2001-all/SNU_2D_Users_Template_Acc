SNU developer log day 426

Today was a really rough day for me. My mood is really beginning to go down after being cooped up for a month. I have canceled updates for today due to how distracted I have been. I have been really low functional all day today, and I just couldn't bring myself to update SNU past documentation. I worked on a different project in my focused time today, all that was held off was an update to the Internet museum, and 3D printing areas. I likely needed this off day to recuperate.

I have also began to spell check on notepad++ I don't know why I didn't do this before, other than fears of it auto-replacing words in the wrong spots. Due to my fast 2 finger typing, I seem to make frequent errors when typing on notepad++ but when using LibreOffice, I keep it a lot neater. There seems to have been at least 2 spelling errors in most entries lately, hopefully I van fix that now. I will try a lot harder to do something tomorrow, since it is April 1st, and I will put out a much better April Fools joke compared to last years. Slightly longer TL;DR: Updates canceled for the day, it is hard being cooped up today, even though I got to work early, I worked on a different project and lost functionality. SNU was not updated.
