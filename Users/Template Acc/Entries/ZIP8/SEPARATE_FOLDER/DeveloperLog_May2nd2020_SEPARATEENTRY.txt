SNU developer log day 458

It is supposed to storm today, and I need to make changes to my schedule, so I got to work extra early today, and tried to finish site development by 3:00 pm. I did the same thing that I have been doing lately again today, just massive amounts of commits via documentation.

There is no need for a bottom description today, not much happened.
