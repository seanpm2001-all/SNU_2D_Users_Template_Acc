SNU developer log day 461

I was better with my schedule today, but some issues occurred. I was still able to get all my projects done. A side project, my audio collection, is close to reaching a goal from the beginning of the year, and I plan to start innovating the project once the goal is reached. I have been productive in other projects, and schoolwork, but SNU will continue to get the same type of update for a while.

I am close to graduating from high school, and I am trying to figure out how to start my future next. I need more time to figure this out. Today, I did the usual documentation update (the one I have been doing for a week now) this project is also close to completion, and I will finish by the middle or ending of May 2020. Today was an OK day for development.
