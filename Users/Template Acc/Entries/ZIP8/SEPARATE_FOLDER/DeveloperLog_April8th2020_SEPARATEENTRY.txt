SNU developer log day 434

I had less development time today, as I woke up later. I didn't plan as much today due to this, as I want to keep it to a reasonable amount. Today, I worked on documentation, a new Torrent section of the site (SNU Torrent, codename omicronTorrent, or simply oTorrent) and a big update (commit-wise) to the SNU Internet Museum, trying to finalize the Valve page. For external documentation, I have decided that I will have support for 6 new formats: Mobi, xml, xps, fodt, doc, and docm. However, it would be too difficult to make 12 additional commits each day, I want to save time for other work. Plus, I don't have any software right now that can create Mobi or XPS files. Today, when exporting the developer log entry, it was the biggest entry I have ever exported, purely because of the 4K image that I included. I was expecting document size to be hundreds of times bigger than usual, but something happened to the RTF export which I found unacceptable: the file took up over 151 megabytes. So to save space, I unfortunately had to modify this document to remove the image. I might create an exception in the future, but right now, I am trying to balance the size of SNU better.

My brother-in-law said he would check out the fake BSoD page that I created, he has been very busy at Microsoft lately, preparing their services to handle more people better. He got to me about it last night before bed. This might pave the way for more spoof pages to be created and updated. Today was a decent day for development, I tried to take it easier today.
