SNU developer log day 451

I created an update similar to recent updates again today. I am having a good time making separate update log and developer log pages. The only major error I made today was forgetting to change the date of the snapshot on the developer log pages. Along with documentation, I also made another ideaboard update, along with some fixes to the HTML Test Reference center, as I noticed some flaws. There was a major English problem on the page for the Blink tag, the grammar was horrendous, and I had to fix it. I also updated the marquee page to include better examples, and documentation. Along with this, I updated the HTML Test References homepage to modernize it. However, there is a CPU issue regarding the usage of iframes, and I am working on finding a fix to this issue.

I worked late in my afternoon session today, and had a relaxed nighttime work session. I did some security research earlier, along with web development research. I have improved significantly in web development since I started the SNU project, but I would also like to stick to computer software development again, so I am taking another course on Python. I found 4 really helpful commands: try, except, finally, and raise. Of the 9+ chapters I did in Python in the 10th and 11th grades, I am really surprised this was never brought up, as I find it extremely useful, and it would have greatly improved my earlier programs. Instead of the program closing and crashing, I can give myself better debug tools, instead of opening and reopening IDLE over and over. I haven't started implementing this into my programs yet, but I will soon on my next Python project. Today was a decent day for site development, it wasn't very hard to work today.
