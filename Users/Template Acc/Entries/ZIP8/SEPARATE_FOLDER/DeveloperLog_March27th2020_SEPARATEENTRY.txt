SNU developer log day 422

I wasn't feeling too up to an update today at first, but I still put one out. Over half of the commits were documentation related again, but today I decided to work on modernizing the old Internet Museum, and I started with the entrance and home pages. These pages haven't been updated since SNU 3.05, over 5-6 months ago. They carry old characreristics, such as the old, unchanged default Windows (CR) (LF) indentation, and the poor syntax (but not the basic 1993 HTML syntax, that hasn't been a thing for almost a whole year now, as I use a template now, and I know many more HTML tags than when I started (over 40x more) along with CSS and JS)

I noticed a new management problem with keeping a zip format download of the developer log and update log entries besides storage, which is that I have to copy all 8 formats separately, and put them in a separate folder before zippig them, as each file type is assigned to its own folder. The problem this causes is high CPU usage, which leads to faster battery depletion, and also it takes extra development time to do this, especially when a weekly entry is involved. I will learn to work with this. Today was a decent day for development. I hope to work on the Internet Museum more, I still feel like it has potential.
