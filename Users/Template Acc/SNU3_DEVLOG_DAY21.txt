SNU 3.0 Developer log day 21
I had the day off from school today, since it wouldn't be worth going in only to have 20 minute classes. 2 Hour delays on a Wednesday shortened schedule is a no
I was going to try and add content to this site today and make a huge update, but instead, I got distracted with a big video project, schoolwork, and some time on YouTube and reddit
However, I was able to start making the tribute to a recent YouTuber who died, Pie Pivot-o.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do much today
