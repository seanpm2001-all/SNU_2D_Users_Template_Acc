I realized yesterday while finalizing work what went wrong with snapshotting the image page. The staff ideaboard wasn't updated on January 14th 2020, I had to snapshot it late, but the image page wasn't forgotten, I accidentally saved it with the name of the video page. So for the numbers to match, this is a reserved snapshot now.
Today I worked on a small filler makeup update, mainly with improvements to holiday and memorial pages, along with documentation, and an improved malware and virus repository page. I could have done more, but I had less time today, and I was really out of it. I will update the developer and update log again tomorrow, they are going to reach snapshot 300.
Today was a slow development today. I might not have as much time to develop the site for the next 2 days due to finals at school. I will still try to make it work, but I might make very limited updates.
