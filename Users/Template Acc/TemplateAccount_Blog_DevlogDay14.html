<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 14</H1>
<p>I had a pretty productive day today. I got alot done in all my projects. I have been mainly working on documetation. I finished up current 4Chan documentation with the resources I currently had, and I also worked on Twitter, FaceBook, and Tumblr</p>
<p>So if you noticed with build 3.03 I have been relying heavily on Internet Historian for a lot of documentation. It is one of the easiest resources I have access to, and he does a good job at it. In the future, I will showcase other people</p>
<p>I also added a little bit of reddit and Vinesauce into internet legends</p>
<p>Overall, today was a very good day</p>
