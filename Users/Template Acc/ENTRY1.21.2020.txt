I had a short development day today, I wasn't too inspired or motivated, and I didn't have much that I wanted to add. I added some improvements to some pages, such as the original ideaboard page, and the image, video, and audio tag test pages. I also did general documentation as usual, however this time without the developer log. I plan on updating the developer log again on January 23rd 2020, as long as I don't have any off days. I have kept entries in a separate text file.
I got some new plans for tomorrow, and I have gotten some more things ready. I hope to have a better day tomorrow if I have the available time. I had a lot of time for another personal project today. I accidentally added in a new bag to 3 pages today regarding text color, and I am working on a fix. The fix won't be implemented until I can work on the pages again.
Today was a short development day, but some progress was made. Again, I will try to do better IF I have the time
