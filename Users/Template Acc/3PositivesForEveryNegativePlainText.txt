3 positives for every negative
On my short walk to class yesterday, I thought of a new idea: 2 positives for 1 negative is a very broken system. The percentages wouldn't be equal enough, and it would be difficult to decide the exact percentage.
3 positives to 1 negative is better, as the positives would be 75% and the negative would be the other 25% it would also work well as 1-4  (1-9) 1-19 1-24 1-49 1-99.
Conclusion: Be more positive
TL:DR: More positives makes easier math
