		<p>Welcome to the SNU developer log!</p>
		<p>Here, you can go through the development of SNU from the beginning of the 3.x builds (soon older builds) and see how the site had changed, and what development was like for the SNU project.</p>
		<p>Posts here are made and managed by SNU staff, and are verified by the creator of SNU (Sean Myrick) at the moment, all logs are made by him, as he is the only one working on the site right now</p>
		<p>Topics range from day-to-day updates, experiences, discoveries, and stories about the internal life of SNU development</p>
		<p>Take a look around! There is plenty to read and learn about here.</p>
		<p>Changes on May 6th 2019</p>
		<p>A few articles on the blog page have been embedded into comments due to them being off topic. From now on, this blog is for SNU development and topics related to development ONLY. The removed articles are still available in older snapshots without editing, but they won't be here directly in new builds anymore.</p>
		<p>At the moment, you can still remove the comment marks, and re-enable them, but they are soon to be removed from future builds. They will be ported to another blog page (Seanpatrickmyrickblogs) once ready.</p>
		<p>This is to make this blog serve its purpose: documenting SNU's development</p>

		<summary><H1 id="OLD_BLOGS">The older blogs have moved</H1></summary>
		<p>when the developer log started, it was purely a blog for site development news, and also opinions and updates from the owner. In the late 3.0.4 phase, it was decided that blogs unrelated to site development would be moved to Seans personal blog page, which was added in 3.0.5. In late 3.0.4 builds, the blogs were removed from view, but could still be viewed as commente in the site source code. This was finally removed, and they were ported to the new blog. From now on, seans blog is separate. Here is a link sheet to the moved blogs

	<summary><H1 id="HOW_SNU_HAS_CHANGED_MY_LIFE">How SNU has changed my life</H1></summary>
		<HR>
		<p>Don't repeat my mistakes</p>
		<p>I ruined a lot of internet experiences for myself. Most commonly, it was YouTube. I really should have done A LOT more research before I started uploading online.</p>
		<p>At the time, it seemed funny, and like a good idea, but looking back on ANY of it, even a month later, it seemed like something that shouldn't even exist.</p>
		<p>I started my career online by making videos on YouTube. They weren't the best videos, and they were pretty bad. I could have done a lot better, but I didn't know how.</p>
		<p>When it got to Minecraft videos, it was like a really bad DanTDM knockoff. This was in 2015, I was 14 at the time, and still didn't know about reality all the way.</p>
		<p>I made a ton of crappy Minecraft videos. Most videos were pointless. I didn't have a good screen recorder, so I was recording my screen with my phone (big no no for professional video development)</p>
		<p>It was difficult to record videos like this, positioning the camera was hard, and I was pumping out crappy videos on the daily. Some videos were good, mostly non-gaming ones. Some were just bad without context.</p>
		<p>When I made the move to go mass-media and try other social media sites, it got worse. On twitter, I had a few friends in real life, and I copied off my friend Jeremy's idea of making "good morning" tweets, but I "improved" on that idea.</p>
		<p>Every morning, a "good morning twitter" tweet, with the date, and a @seanwallawalla #seanwallawalla, followed by a tweet in the afternoon, the same thing, except for instead of "good morning twitter" it would be "Good afternoon twitter"</p>
		<p>The same pattern followed for the evening tweet, which was sent out between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm normally, unless I got to it late, and a final tweet of the day (a goodnight tweet) where I would announce I stopped using twitter for the night, and also include an ASCII art pattern, and a duplicate of the text to reach the max character limit.</p>
		<p>These weren't the only tweets I sent. Sometimes, I would give little status updates, and such. This wasn't as toxic as my activity on other sites, but I still look upon it in a bad light.</p>
		<p>I also created a Tumblr account. I didn't post porn or fanfictions on Tumblr. I was misusing the site. I didn't know what it was capable of. However, I would spam hashtags on my posts, like 40+ hashtags for a post about a screenshot.</p>
		<p>Most of it was just YouTube status updates. One time, I posted a story about going into the crawlspace of my house, or celebrating Christmas. I didn't post here as much as the other sites. These weren't really the bad things.</p>
		<p>The things I look down upon is following and liking fanfiction (before I knew what fanfiction was, I was a slow learner on these things at the time) so stuff like "Zootopia fanfiction" was popping in my feed.</p>
		<p>I had a stupid rule at the time: see it? like it!</p>
		<p>This didn't apply for everything, some things I knew NOT to like. I still had common sense. I didn't learn about a lot of things like "69" "Anal" etc until I was 16 and a half, and older. That's when my mind went dirty</p>
		<p>Overall, my social media experience was toxic. I also was into web design. I used the new Google sites before I got to making the JavaScript (failed port of SNU) and HTML hyperbase (Version 3.0.x of SNU) in web development</p>
		<p>The Google sites site wasn't the best either, it was decent. It was the starting foundation of visualizing what SNU was going to look like. Originally, it wasn't for SNU, it was for my online database as a whole.</p>
		<p>However, one day, I decided to sneak NSFW content into my site, and I added "sophisticated" means of getting to it. You could just copy the link, the 20 sex ed questions were not a good move.</p>
		<p>I look upon this very badly, and really want to get past it. My fetish seems like a curse. I can't get rid of it. So much of it was shown online, and nobody really found out about it yet somehow.</p>
		<p>With what I do, you are going to need all the correct context that you can get.</p>
		<p>My uploading finally died down after the fall of the statistic video era, when Movie Maker just couldn't take me uploading 400+ images into it every day. A lot of images were turning out corrupted, and I didn't have time to go back and fix them, and I made my first smart decision: to stop making them.</p>
		<p>Almost 2 years of nonstop daily statistic videos were finally over in August of 2018. I uploaded to YouTube bi-monthly after that, but then stopped completely. At one point, I tried Vimeo, but didn't like it as much, and abandoned my account.</p>
		<p>One last thing to discuss: YouTube comments</p>
		<p>When I started commenting on YouTube, I would make a bunch of random comments. I was trying to be like Justin Y before Justin Y even existed. This resulted in me commenting on any video I watched. I didn't think all of them through, and I don't look back on this fondly</p>
		<p>Just whatver you do,</p>
		<p><b>DON'T</b></p>
		<p><b>REPEAT</b></p>
		<p><b>MY</b></p>
		<p><b>MISTAKES</b></p>
		<p>This has been stressing me out for years, but now today, I am now finally over it. I can sleep easy again.</p>

	<p>Development on SNU has lasted for 2 months now, and it has changed my life behind the scenes. I have put in hours upon hours of effort into SNU, on a daily basis. I have dropped certain activities and projects, and I have learned a lot from it.</p>
	<p>One of the first things that had to go was my gaming. I haven't played games on my phone in a long time now, and I used to play everyday for almost a whole year.</p>
	<p>It has also changed the way I work and gave me a great taste of web design. Thanks to W3schools, I have achieved a very good level of HTML knowledge, and it is a very helpful reference.</p>
	<p>This site still has a long ways to go, and I enjoy the experience it has given me.</p>

	<p>While developing SNU, I used special characters. They made the site look better in ways. However, there was a limit between special characters and Emojis. Eventually, I started placing Emojis next to titles of sections, and it made it look more lively.</p>
	<p>Emojis get lost in translation. I am going to keep the original text there, as it would be difficult to figure out what it was with just Emojis, and it would be unprofessional.</p>
	<p>I mainly use Emojis on the sidebars of my website, however that could change. Using them has made me like them more. It is better than black, white, and grey characters in the right situations.</p>

	<p>Most sites don't let you control what ads you see without paying for premium... that is unless you use an adblock. However, SNU is different. SNU lets you control what ads you see. If a specific ad or type of ad bothers you, you can just turn it off via ad settings</p>
	<p>You can't turn ads off completely though, as ads are a way to support the site. We have decided to punish people who use adblock on SNU. If you have your content monetized, you will lose 1 cent of revenue for every ad that is blocked. Make sure to whitelist our site.</p>

	<summary><H1 id="PLANS_FOR_SNU_M3V6">Plans for SNU 3.0 Version 6</H1></summary>
	<p>SNU is going to get a major update on June 14th 2019. Milestone 6 is going to be released, and I am planning an overhaul on how the framework is designed. All the original media from Version 5 will stay, but it will be organized better.</p>
	<p>For example, images, video, audio, documents, and programs will be placed in different sections, while the main HTML will reach out to them. This organization is neccesary, as this site is pretty unorganized at the moment.</p>
	<p>Snapshot builds will be placed in new folders as well, but at the cost of this, links to older snapshots before the update will no longer work.</p>
	<p>I am saving this for version 6, as it will take a while to implement, and summer break will start by then. This update should make the site faster, and more easily accessible. M3V5 will still remain in the SNU old section, and will be linked to M3V6</p>
	<p>Stylesheets will also be placed in their own folders, and throughout the 4 months from June 14th 2019 to October 14th 2019, there will be a similar update schedule as version 5.</p>
	<p>Version 7 will be released on October 14th 2019, but currently that is too far away to talk about now, as there will be tens of thousands of changes to SNU within the next 6 months.</p>
	<p></p>

	<p>Yesterday, I had a few scares with advertisements and popups. I have had a solution for a while, and these recent events reminded me of it.</p>
	<p>When ads are implemented, there will be a layer of security for ads. If you were to accidentally click on one, it wouldn't immediately take you to the ad. There will be a confirmation layer by SNU that the advertiser has no access to.</p>
	<p>This confirmation will prevent ricky clicks as it will warn you what you are getting into. There will be a 2 second delay before the buttons show up, so that you have enough time to react. This is also another step in ditching your adblocker.</p>
	<p>This will also come default in the ad settings</p>

	<p>Yesterday, I decided to start integrating each part of SNU into its own section at a faster and more efficient rate. I am starting with the blog feature. There will be some changes now:</p>
	<p>* The blog editor that was located in the templateaccountblogs folder is now obsolete. You will need to use the official editor (don't worry, all the original contents are still there, you won't get support past version 1.01 for the templateaccountblogs links (which has been removed in modern templateaccountblogs versions)</p>
	<p>* There is now an official homepage for the new SNU blog page. It currently only has 1 post, which gives general information on the feature</p>
	<p>This should NOT be confused with SNU books, which has a different approach</p>

	<summary><H1 id="MY_EXPERIENCE_WITH_NOTEPAD++">My experience with notepad++</H1></summary>
	<p>Notepad++ is my favorite IDE. I have been using it for years, and it works really well. However, there are some issues with it that I have experienced frequently.</p>
	<p>On my second laptop (201?-2019) I used notepad++ freqsuently on my laptop. However, when a document surpassed 360 kilobytes in size, it would be slightly prone to crashing. When it crashes, if you didn't save the file beforehand, or it got stuck saving, unless you kept backup versions, you would lose EVERYTHING. As soon as you reopen notepad++, the file gets overwritten. And it gets worse as the file gets larger. Once it reaches 1 megabyte, crashes can happen very frequently, and you have to backup at almost every update.</p>
	<p>The laptop was a low spec computer, 4 gigabytes of RAM, 512 Gigabytes HDD, with a 1.6 Gigahertz processor. When I finally got a new laptop, I haven't had the issue, until April 11th 2019. After about 20 minutes of use, I went to save a snapshot of a file. I saved the original file, and when I copy and pasted the snapshot and tried to save it, it immediately crashed, and when I came back, it acted like nothing even happened.</p>
	<p>This is alarming, because these crashes become frequent, and I have some big projects I am working on. Due to this, I have to back up SNU a lot more frequently.</p>
	<p>Another very small issue I have is, when I reopen the application, the encoding on all UTF-8 documents reverts to ANSI, and I have to change it back or else I deal with mojibaked text and [SYN] blocks.</p>
	<p>Other than that, it is the best IDE. It has strong support and many features with several programming languages, takes little memory, and is lightweight (less than 5 megabytes for the whole program)</p>
	<p>I hope they can even out the bugs I have in the future.</p>

	<summary><H1 id="APRIL_13_2019_SECURIY_UPDATE">SNU Security update - Saturday April 13th 2019</H1></summary>
	<p>So there has been a security issue recently that has had no effect on SNU, but I should share:</p>
	<p>I am really careful when I use the internet. I haven't got a virus on my primary computer in a really long time. Recently however, a Trojan spread onto my computer and it was immediately quaratined before it could execute, which means it wasn't even a bad one if even Windows Defender can find it</p>
	<p>I haven't been on any unusual sites lately, so this caught me off guard. The Trojan was successfully destroyed on Thursday April 11th 2019. It hasn't come back since. It had no effect on my computer, no files were removed or altered.</p>
	<HR>
	<p>Now let's talk about the security of SNU. I have recently took the time to switch to Duck Duck Go on Firefox so now I have a tool to help me check the security of sites, it was an add-on that came with the search engine, and it is pretty good, so I kept it</p>
	<p>At the moment, SNU has not been made public. I have been keeping it private, and I am the soul lone developer for it. I have put over a hundred hours of work into it in the past 2 and a half months. Since it is stored entirely on my hard drive, it doesn't have an HTTPS connection yet, so this rating for encrypted connection isn't there.</p>
	<p>I don't plan on using trackers on my site, I plan on keeping it fair for all users. Everyone here has the right to their privacy. Unlike Facebook and Google, I value the users privacy on my site. However, again, this site hasn't been launched yet, it is just a cluster of HTML documents, CSS spreadsheets, and media files scattered over an offline file system.</p>
	<p>So DDG (Duck Duck Go) can't check for privacy practices. Once the site is running, this grade should rise from a C+ to an A</p>

	<summary><H1 id="NO_FULL_CONTROL_OVER_THE_INTERNET">Why SNU shouldn't dominate the internet</H1></summary>
	<p>Right now on the internet, we are mainly dominated by just a few companies, big examples include Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and some other ones. We plan on going on that list, but we cannot knock out all the competition</p>
	<p>The problem with relying entirely upon a few services is, those services have to have downtime sometimes. AWS and Google dominate most of the internet. When those go down, even for a minute, it can cause issues worldwide.</p>
	<p>There should always be an alternate ready. SNU was originally planned to be an alternate to YouTube, but it turned into an alternate to everything. However, we don't recommend importing your accounts into SNU, and not visit their site anymore.</p>
	<p>SNU is going to go down at times too, whether we want it to or not. Always make sure you have a backup. For this reason, the way SNU will be supporting outside businesses is by linking traffic from SNU to their site. So if you make $0.06 off of SNU, $0.02 of it would go to you, $0.02 of it would be split with the site it is sharing to, and $0.02 of it would be sent to SNU. See? Balanced.</p>
	<p>Other than just internet services, you should be even more prepared. Try buying a computer with a hard drive (not a ChromeBook) where you can download content and save it for offline use. SNU is going to be an alternate for every site, but it should NEVER replace every site. This is why you can download any piece of content off SNU (except for restricted content, like TV shows and movies that are still under copyright protection)</p>
	<p>This is a common occurance nowadays that shouldn't be happening: when the internet goes down, everything stops. Businesses (like hospitals) don't carry hard copies of patient records, so if the internet goes down for even 5 minutes, doctors won't know what to do with the patients, as all their info is stored on a server. Always make sure to keep a hard copy when possible!</p>
	<p>TL;DR: use SNU but also make sure to use other sites, as SNU won't be up 24/7/365, and save a copy of your work offline for later use</p>

	<p>I have found a way to make advertisements even more fair on SNU. This is on the creators end: every 4 cents you make off of ad revenue, the money is split in 4 ways:</p>
	<p>* 1 cent out of the 4 cents goes to the advertiser</p>
	<p>* 1 cent out of the 4 cents goes to the hosted website</p>
	<p>* 1 cent goes to you</p>
	<p>* 1 cent goes to SNU</p>
	<p>This way, we can benefit you, the advertiser, ourselves, and also another website</p>

	<p>When I modify SNU, I tend to reuse my assets very frequently. You may notice that the title of the page is incorrect, comments don't seem to fit what the page is, or sections may be completely irrelevant. This is because sometimes I forget about them.<p>
	<p>But now, it is getting ridiculous. So I am trying to combat my usage of these. However, there are some things that I used that use tags completely irrelevant to ANYTHING being worked on.</p>
	<p>For example, some dropdown menus may have car names in their tags, or radio buttons have gender tags. Why are these there? I used w3schools for some assets, and built off and modified that, but forgot to remove these tags, as they do not appear on the general view of the webpage</p>
	<p>This is my story on reuse of assets for this website.</p>

	<p>SNU is planned on being a huge thing. Right now it is small, but due to poor resources at the moment, a limit is coming up.</p>
	<p>Notepad++ hasn't crashed in a while, but when it does, there has to be a backup in place. This is why snapshots are made. When a document gets really big, it gets slower on the computer. At 2 Megabytes, with 8 gigabytes of RAM, lag is noticable, but isn't that severe. The biggest document I have written is 2.20 Megabytes at the moment (of just text) and it is surprisingly stable. My last computer wouldn't be able to handle it this far</p>
	<p>SNU isn't really that big yet with its HTML files (not including bookmark exports, those average around 15+ megabytes each right now) However, they are starting to get pretty big. The common documents I use, like blogs, are already up and over 180 kilobytes in size, and there is almost no lag. However, it is on its way to that point, it is bigger than most of its external assets (pictures) but it isn't much of a threat yet.</p>
	<p>I tend to look really far into the future, I am just writing this as a "you have been warned" reminder.</p>

	<p>All social media sites have some way of having users accumulate internet points. They go by likes, karma, reputation, upvotes, loves, favorites, and more. This is a good feature, as it tells you how good the post is, but it has its flaws.</p>
	<p>These days, people use internet points to boast their appearance in public, even going to the lengths of stealing and reuploading someones work with no credit. For example, the user GallowBoob on reddit takes over subreddits, and makes a post that is completely irrelevant to what the subreddit is, and still gets an average of 60,000 upvotes. This is a pretty bad thing.</p>
	<p>GallowBoob is an example of when it is taken too far. GallowBoob works his way into moderator status, and censors everyone who criticizes him. At the moment, he has over 22 million karma. At least 15 million of that isn't deserved. </p>
	<p>They can also be a way to unfairly win arguments. Like if someone creates multiple accounts, and starts an argument. Someone has the right answer, and you start using alt accounts to dislike or downvote them. This is not true in all situations, but when it happens, it shouldn't even happen.</p>
	<p>I am still working on a system to help keep the balance and not have stuff like this happen</p>

	<p>Currently, the release schedule for SNU 3 is one major update every 6 months. This has led to the introduction to the snapshot system. The reason behind this was the immense size SNU took up after the entire Big Buck Bunny Video suite was added in, totaling in over 10 and a half gigabytes.</p>
	<p>Today, I have noticed that this system is too similar to Ubuntu's release schedule, which has an update every 6 months, one in April (??.04), and one in October (??.10) This system might change.</p>
	<p>SNU 3.06 is expected to bring big changes, such as efficient sorted directories, thousands of new features, better CSS quality, and more. The update will launch privately on June 14th 2019.</p>
	<p>M3V6 stands for <b>M</b>ilestone <b>3</b> <b>V</b>ersion <b>6</b></p>
	<p>The current date is April 28th 2019, 47 days away from the June 14th 2019 update. Since SNU is still a private project, it is just an update for the one developer, Sean Myrick. No content will be lost in the transition</p>

	<p>Right now, the only 2 things that are setting me back from getting an A are:</p>
	<p><b>Getting an HTTPS connection (the site hasn't even launched yet)</b></p>
	<p><b>Getting past "unknown privacy practices" (the site hasn't even launched yet)</b></p>
	<p>Currently, my grade is a C+. My site is not going to have any trackers, and it itself won't be a major tracker network. I will focus on this later when I actually launch the site.</p>

	<p>In the future, I am thinking about getting a 3 letter domain for my website. Right now, in case all else fails, it will be called "https://www.socialnetworkultimate.net" but I am thinking about purchasing the "https://www.snu.net" domain in the future.</p>
	<p>There are some pros for this:</p>
	<p>* searching for the site would be really easy, as you would only need to type 3 letters.</p>
	<p>* both domains mean the same thing</p>
	<p>* it would be easy to memorize</p>
	<p>The only problem at the moment is:</p>
	<p>* it might cost a lot of money to buy this domain name</p>
	<p>* it might get taken shortly, as I don't know if it is taken</p>
	<p>It is a plan for the future. It would be nice to have a simple site name.</p>

	<p>I regret not recording development on the site for a long time, but I can't do it. Currently, there are multiple issues preventing this:</p>
	<p>* I don't have a good screen recorder for my laptop</p>
	<p>* it would take up a lot of memory to record development so frequently, and I already have enough memory issues at the moment as it is</p>
	<p>When I do it, I plan on following a specific order. There is also the risk of recording it in 720p and I am not sure that would hold up too well in the future. I am going to create a checklist so that I don't forget anything, and I will have a separate audio track version.</p>
	<p>Since I listen to music while working, I might have to record the music separately, but there wouldn't be a point in it</p>
	<p>Hopefully I can start by SNU 3.0.7 or SNU 3.0.8</p>

	<p>Template account was added as a user profile in the early days of SNU 3 development. It was first used as a test of user profiles in the site. At the time, it didn't have a blog, it consisted of several media tests.</p>
	<p>As time went on, a blog page was added, and development started on it. It turned into a developer log/personal log for the site creator Sean Myrick. Over a long period of time, it transitioned into being a developer log only. This is soon to be confirmed on SNU 3.0.5/SNU C1.0.5</p>

	<p>I didn't have the best development day today, not much was added, and I was caught up in a lot of other things. I got burnt out of the project a bit yesterday and it lasted into today</p>
	<p>Hopefully tomorrow is better</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 3rd 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 5</H2>
	<p>Today was a better day in development. So the user profile now has an immense amount of sections, currently totaling at 125. Today was mostly an index update, along with adding settings, and fixing up the blog sections</p>
	<p>Today was A LOT better than yesterday at least</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 4th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 6</H2>
	<p>Sorting is taking forever now. I managed to add in all the new sections, there are 123 total sections as of right now. Also, yes I am aware that there is a duplicate [downloads] link in the profile, but to fix that within 123 different documents, that would take WAT too long</p>
	<p>At least today was a better development day than yesterday</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 5th 2019</p>
	<H2>snu 3.0 Developer log day 7</H2>
	<p>The first week of development has finished and I have laid a pretty good foundation</p>
	<p>I have been getting a lot of progress with new settings, currently, I am working on cloud storage and personalization settings</p>
	<p>I also created my first HTML stylesheet today, then I got burnt out as soon as I figured out how to connect a hyperlink</p>

	<p>Today is the first day of the second week of development. Honestly, I think these burnout periods I am experiencing are actually helpful, as it spans out more time for me to implent and think of new ideas and ways to shape SNU into the way I want it to be</p>
	<p>This is just the very tip of the iceberg, but this site has so much potential</p>
	<p>Today, I worked on hyperlinks through multiple files and setting up "index bases" in the SNU 2 folders so SNU 3 can have easy access to the legacy version</p>

	<p>A small update today, but a little bigger than yesterday's. I have a lot of ideas, but I cannot implement all of them today. Tomorrow I go on a trip to Spokane, so there could either be more development time if I am comfortable enough to work in the truck, or less if I can't access the site, or have to use it in the hotel</p>
	<p>The Pie Pivot-o tribute is coming along slowly, but it will be worth it in the end, as it will be a beacon to celebrate his life and all he has done on the internet. It's still really sad that he lost his life so early</p>

	<p>I am back from my vacation. I have some updates</p>
	<p>I did some work on this site today on the car trip back to Walla Walla. </p>
	<p>Mostly, the work I did was for the pie pivot-o archive. I got 20 videos embedded during the car ride</p>
	<p>So I have to make a website for my parents apartment. I don't have a server to dedicate to this, and my HTML and web development skills aren't good enough to make this on my local harddrive so for now, I am going to have to make it in Google sites</p>
	<p>Once Google allows downloading your modern Google sites websites, it will be all good. This is a mini-project, it shouldn't take long, and it would give me a little exposure</p>
	<p>I made a basic demo of the site today, and it works well</p>

	<p>Today was an easy day for this project. I haven't been feeling that good, a lot of anxiery pain. So I finished up the Pie Pivot-o Tribute by adding all video descriptions, and his opinion on CharmX, and I also added 2 new features to SNU:</p>
	<p>User !666 and !Heaven</p>
	<p>The 666 user is SNUs personal hell. You can visit it, where I try to make the most demonic scary part of the site. I also made a transition and made SNU heaven, a place with the all-time best content, and links to the fallen creators</p>
	<p>I did some updates to the update log and the developer log, and that is pretty much it.</p>

	<p>I am really glad I introduced the new snapshot system into this SNU project. Recently this morning, there was a severe system crash. My computer froze for over 20 minutes, and I lost 20 minutes worth of work on a new build on a different project</p>
	<p>It would be really unfortunate to lose ANY page in this collection, so Snapshots are going to be important</p>
	<p>Today, I am rebooting development on Legends of the Internet. Today, I focus on Vinesauce and 4Chan</p>
	<p>I am also working on the new time-machine mode, viewing media from different time periods. Currently it goes down all the way to 1788</p>

	<p>A small update today, but a little bigger than yesterday's. I have a lot of ideas, but I cannot implement all of them today. Tomorrow I go on a trip to Spokane, so there could either be more development time if I am comfortable enough to work in the truck, or less if I can't access the site, or have to use it in the hotel</p>
	<p>The Pie Pivot-o tribute is coming along slowly, but it will be worth it in the end, as it will be a beacon to celebrate his life and all he has done on the internet. It's still really sad that he lost his life so early</p>

	<p>I went inactive for a few days. Really sorry about that. I am not going to let this version of SNU die that easily though. I began working on the web app version of my calculator as practice for my introduction to CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets) and I forgot about SNU for a while</p>
	<p>SNU is not dead, but it is going to need to be repaired a little bit. I am going to start doing big repairs when I get better at CSS, I am just starting with it. HTML seems easy but CSS really makes it fun. Today, I simply updated the developer and update logs.</p>

	<p>5G is coming soon, and it will be a great advantage to this site.

	<p>Today, I got no progress on the site, I was working on a Factorial Machine for my calculator, and I managed to perfect it to its limits. Development on SNU will continue tomorrow.</p>

	<p>Yesterday was a really productive day. Today wasn't. I was really hyper today, and had a lack of focus on different projects. I wasn't able to do anything to SNU today. So I have also grown a new hobby, bookmarks. This is a small hobby, I am making a very organized bookmarks file system in Firefox to help me organizr tabs better. This list will be updated and added to SNU every day a change is made. </a>
	<p>This hobby should not replace SNU</p>
	<p>Later in the day, I hit a limit, then surpassed it with bookmarks and separaters. I thought there was a limit, but I just made an error. However just today, the number of bookmarks and separaters over doubled with my bookmark archive and I didn't get much done with SNU except for a basic stylesheet on the start page, archive updates, and writing to the blog</p>
	<p>Today could have been a lot better, hopefully my excitement with bookmarks will go down soon</p>

	<p>Development hasn't been going that well lately. The Filthy Frank tribute is also going to be reset, as I found a master archive with all his videos, and I can't apply it right now as I need to conserve memory better.</p>
	<p>I have also been developing SNU mostly in English. I need to make it available to other languages, but I don't have any secondary languages I am good at, and I cannot rely on Google translate.</p>
	<p>So I am going to have to work on smaller features, by the kilobyte, NOT THE MEGABYTE OR GIGABYTE.</p>
	<p>One of my new ideas this morning is personal pages for peoples pets. This will require some moderation, but wouldn't it be nice to be able to create a separate account specially designed for animals?</p>
	<p>There are a lot of projects I am working on right now and it is going to correlate to SNU very well. There are a few features in beta right now:</p>
	<p>Password generator [Python] current version: 1.04</p>
	<b>A password generator that allows for intricate password generation from 9 to 256 characters</b>
	<p>WebShapes3D [Java] current version: 1.00</p>
	<b>A 3D environment for 3D animations and objects on SNU</b>
	<p>Today, I applied some minor updates. Development should continue again normally soon</p>

	<p>I have had a large influx of ideas for SNU today, and I am trying to implement as many as possible. I have been really productive lately, except for a severe laptop issue that has happened for the second time: it randomly deep froze. The only way to stop the freeze was to shut down</p>
	<p>I don't know what is causing it, but I do NOT want to have to go get a fourth/fifth laptop this year, the other 2 I had were returned because they overheated and shut down within 5 minutes of bootup.</p>
	<p>Due to my new experience in JavaScript, I might start development on the 3D side of SNU pretty soon, if I can get better experience in CSS and JS.</p>

	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on March 8th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 38</H2>
	<p>Yesterday was a really productive day. Today wasn't. I was really hyper today, and had a lack of focus on different projects. I wasn't able to do anything to SNU today. So I have also grown a new hobby, bookmarks. This is a small hobby, I am making a very organized bookmarks file system in Firefox to help me organizr tabs better. This list will be updated and added to SNU every day a change is made. </a>
	<p>This hobby should not replace SNU</p>
	<p>Later in the day, I hit a limit, then surpassed it with bookmarks and separaters. I thought there was a limit, but I just made an error. However just today, the number of bookmarks and separaters over doubled with my bookmark archive and I didn't get much done with SNU except for a basic stylesheet on the start page, archive updates, and writing to the blog</p>
	<p>Today could have been a lot better, hopefully my excitement with bookmarks will go down soon</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on March 9th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 39</H2>
	<p>I got back to work on SNU today, and made some changes, such as standard updates and snapshots, access to a new alt account for Sean, and updates to the Filthy Frank tribute. I also got through the first week of my new bookmark frenzy</a>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on March 10th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 40</H2>
	<p>My bookmark project reached its first issue this morning. I found out that there is a limit on dividers. Hopefully there isn't a limit on folders and bookmarks as well</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on March 11th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 41</H2>
	<p>Development hasn't been going that well lately. The Filthy Frank tribute is also going to be reset, as I found a master archive with all his videos, and I can't apply it right now as I need to conserve memory better.</p>
	<p>I have also been developing SNU mostly in English. I need to make it available to other languages, but I don't have any secondary languages I am good at, and I cannot rely on Google translate.</p>
	<p>So I am going to have to work on smaller features, by the kilobyte, NOT THE MEGABYTE OR GIGABYTE.</p>
	<p>One of my new ideas this morning is personal pages for peoples pets. This will require some moderation, but wouldn't it be nice to be able to create a separate account specially designed for animals?</p>
	<p>There are a lot of projects I am working on right now and it is going to correlate to SNU very well. There are a few features in beta right now:</p>
	<p>Password generator [Python] current version: 1.04</p>
	<b>A password generator that allows for intricate password generation from 9 to 256 characters</b>
	<p>WebShapes3D [Java] current version: 1.00</p>
	<b>A 3D environment for 3D animations and objects on SNU</b>
	<p>Today, I applied some minor updates. Development should continue again normally soon</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on March 12th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 42</H2>
	<p>I have had a large influx of ideas for SNU today, and I am trying to implement as many as possible. I have been really productive lately, except for a severe laptop issue that has happened for the second time: it randomly deep froze. The only way to stop the freeze was to shut down</p>
	<p>I don't know what is causing it, but I do NOT want to have to go get a fourth/fifth laptop this year, the other 2 I had were returned because they overheated and shut down within 5 minutes of bootup.</p>
	<p>Due to my new experience in JavaScript, I might start development on the 3D side of SNU pretty soon, if I can get better experience in CSS and JS.</p>

	<p>Today, I created event pages for the world wide webs 30th anniversary (2 days late) and Pi-day, along with other changes. Development is going at normal speed right now</p>
	<p>I spotted an issue with the website today: the front page of 2D mode has some lag to it. It is just loading off a hard drive right now, not even connected to the internet, and I don't know what is causing the lag. There aren't ANY videos on the page, the document file size is less than 40 kilobytes, it has a solid background, not an excessive amount of tezt, some images, and animations, hyperlinks, and that is pretty much it.</p>
	<p>I need to fix this issue before it gets worse, but I don't know how.</p>

	<p>Today, I added a copypasta kitchen, with some testing to get copypastas ready to use by a single click. There is a lot to the copypasta kitchen.</p>
	<p>Daily update features were added as well. However, today wasn't the best day of development. A few minimal changes here and there were made.</p>

	<p>SNU development will continue, this Tetris project should give me better experience for how I want to style SNU's graphics.</p>
	<p>Orher than that, I pretty much took the day off, worked on my Scratch project archive, watched videos, worked on bookmarks, and took time off.</p>
	<p>There have been some pretty great development days this week and I am going to stick by them, and work on improvements over time peacefully.</p>

	<p>Today is my 18th birthday! Unfortunately, it is a school day, so I am going to have a shorter party. I got some work done on SNU, it is coming along great now! I am upgrading the sidebar CSS and it makes the sidebar perfect! Once I get the sidebar to a point where I like it enough, and it works correspondingly with the top navigation bar, I will consider adding sidebars to all pages. Each page will have its own unique sidebar.</p>
	<p>Today wasn't the day for my bookmark system though, however that is just a small hobby. Mini updates went around SNU today, with snapshots for multiple pages, and documentation upgrades. Today was pretty good.</p>
	<p>So lately I have been thinking about what I should use as a domain name for SNU. www.snu.net would be a difficult name to get, but it would make it extremely easy for people to access the site. www.socialnetworkultimate.net or www.social-network-ultimate.net seem a little long, and I don't know how much I am going to have to spend to get the domain "snu" its just a domain name, but it can make a big difference.</p>
	<p>This site is still years from being ready for launch, so I have time.</p>

	<p>So the Article 13 from the European Union is up for debate again, however I really doubt it is going to pass. There is already so much hate for it, and it seems like mainly only Germany is supporting it, so I don't see it passing. If it ever does pass, there will be a revolution.

	<p>Even if it does pass, I will continue to work on SNU, as I hope to finish it some day. Today was a decent day for development. I made a few changes, and increased language support (except people are going to need to translate it) the translation form for 2DStart is ready. All I need now is someone who can speak English and another language fluentlu and is willing to take the time to help translate each snapshot</p>
	<p>For the SNU translations for the 2D start page, I got significant progress today, adding support for up to 104 languages (when translated). It took hours, but it will be worth it when the whole world can enjoy SNU.</p>

	<P>So my prediction on Article 13 was wrong. They actually passed it. I didn't want to have to do this, but I am now applying a full-on ban for ANYONE in the European Union from accessing my site until Article 13 is repealed. Hopefully they repeal it by the time my site launches, or it is really going to suck for them.</p>

Hopefully they repeal it by the time my site launches, or it is really going to suck for them.</p>
	<p>Today, I applied notices about that, and worked on a new virtual machine player.</p>

	<p>I had a lot of other projects today and less time than usual, so I didn't get as much done. Very sorry about that.</p>
	<p>However, later in the day, I was able to do a more major update, and add in better virtualization features, along with overall site documentation updates. Today wasn't a complete failure for this project.</p>

	<p>I am working on this virtual machine feature for SNU still. Originally, it was going to be a separate product, but it works fine with SNU.</p>
	<p>I also applied a weekly update to the templateaccountblogs page 1 day late.</p>

	<p>Today, I learned some new HTML tags, such as >summary< and >details< (I separated the < and > so it wouldn't affect the styling of this page) However, it is going to take a while to implement these tags throughout specific pages on the site.</p>
	<p>For now, most of the new style is being placed on the blog page for templateaccount, which is my testing account for what an account should be styled like. Today, I also added new support to the virtual machine system, and updated other pages to keep the site up to date.</p>
	<p>My spring break finally starts tomorrow, and I will be able to get a lot more done.</p>

	<p>Today was an evaluation day. Nothing much happened to SNU. Plus today is the first day of Spring break. I needed a little break. I am starting development on my calculator again. I am evaluating on things like:</p>
	<p><i><b> â€¢ How I should manage my projects</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b> â€¢ Worker goals</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b> â€¢ How I am going to operate the calculator (if I should use custom functions or not)</b></i></p>
	<p>I also took today as a break. I focused on smaller projects only, all I did for SNU today was update the developer log, and update log.</p>

	<p>Today wasn't the best day for development, however not many of the main features are being implemented.</p>
	<p>One thing I like about April fools day, is that I get to see peoples creative and comedic approaches to making a fool out of someone.</p>
	<p>Also, due to time zones, some people upload their April fools day jokes on April 1st in their time zone, but March 31st in other timezones. For this reason, it is still considered April fools day on March 31st for some time zones, and April 1st for other time zones</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, I didn't have any April fools day ideas for the site this year, so you can accept the one from yesterday. I have also decided to bring in another feature to SNU, a map of the universe. Like Google Earth, but universal, more interactive, and more advanced.</p>
	<p>It will be available strictly in 3D mode, and you will be able to see not only Earth, but the moon, Mars, the sun, even past the Milky Way Galaxy. This is a future idea, and it is going to take insane amount of memory in a standard 3 years from today.</p>
	<p>I hope someday I can work together with NASA, and other space organizations to increase the functionality of the universal map, and get new data for it.</p>

	<p>Yeah, yesterday's announcement on SNU Universe wasn't a joke. That is going to be a real thing. Sorry about the poor April fools day yesterday, I wasn't really prepared, and I don't have an audience besides myself to get feedback, as SNU is still in a very early beta.</p>
	<p>Today, I got a lot done. I sat down and worked for over 2 hours this morning. I added in lots of new features, such as ad settings, where you can manage what ads you see, a big update to the dashboard, finishing up the colored text in the HTML master sheet, and brief documentation.</p>
	<p>I have other things to do today, hopefully I can come back to developing SNU again later.</p>

	<p>Today was a dark day outside, lack of sunlight can be depressing. I didn't have much planned for SNU today, so I did minimal updates. I am predicting this, but if we launch SNU universe, Google is going to make Google Mars or a different name/expansion to Google earth.</p>
	<p>I don't have the skills right now to make it, but it is under way within the idea list.</p>
	<p>Today, I had to go search for hate symbols to update the anti-racism engine. SNU will allow these symbols ONLY in educational, historical, and parody purposes, but promoting hate speech on SNU could result in permanent account suspension.</p>
	<p>Later in the day, I started playing games again. I haven't played these games on my phone since February 28th 2019. I didn't have the best time coming back, but I remembered some things that I need to implement into my ad system.</p>

	<p>Today wasn't the best day for development. It is on the decline again. SNU is getting really advanced now, and I am going to have to learn a new language (possibly PHP) and further Javascript and CSS to improve the site more.</p>
	<p>The ad engine is getting really good. Soon I am going to get these options to work. I hope it makes ad creators more diverse, and creative, as that is what this engine promotes: difference.

	<p>So last night I got stressed out, as I realized that wr are getting close to reaching the limit of a silicon chip, and the obsolesence of Moore's law. I am going to have to be more careful with resources, however it shouldn't be too much of an issue, as we have 1 terabyte SD cards that are extremely tiny.

	<p>Almost forgot to write in here today: Today was a makeup day with slight new features. I have replaced every long line of equal-signs with a single <:HR> tag ( minus the : ) today, and it has made the page look better, and also take up less space.</p>
	<p>There were a few brief updates today, and I made a big controversial move for the site: limiting ad blocking. There has been a new monetization system put in place today that punishes people who skip ads. Now, when people skip ads, it builds up. They lose their own earnings for every ad that is blocked.</p>
	<p>The system is designed to make it so people who upload content and want money for their content can't be a hypocrite and block ads when viewing other peoples content. When you block too many ads (40000) you lose the ability to monetize your content for 6 months.</p>
	<p>This new rule was put into place to protect the SNU economy once it starts. Keep in mind, I am the only person making and managing this site at the moment. It is a lot of work to do this every day, and eventually I am going to need a team of people. Right now, I am just laying down the foundation and ideas.</p>
	<p>Spring Break is almost over and I have wasted so much time during it, because of medication issues, that I really missed out on doing massive improvements to this site. I still got a lot done, however, just not as much as I could.</p>

	<p>Last night, a big part of the site started development: I am finally putting in the designs. Starting off in the blog section, you will notice that the background isn't a solid color anymore, and the text is white instead of black.</p>
	<p>You will also notice some transparent boxes. This is something I have been trying to add to this page for a while, last night I started with the CSS.</p>
	<p>Currently, I have the hyperlink section working fully functional, and I tried putting in a transparent box over a < details > tag, but the box overrode the < details > and now the text won't show up.</p>
	<p>This is a new feature, and it is currently being worked on. Once I get the strategy down, it should spread to all other parts of the blog.</p>
	<p>On a later update that lasted me past 10:00 pm, I realized the text was showing, but it was the same color as the box. So the color was changed, and I spent over 30 minutes applying this to ALL the blogs.</p>
	<p>I have also attached a stylesheet to this page, it is slowly becoming more advanced.</p>
	<p>Today, I have updated the blog page further. I have decided to add a sticky sidebar, comment dividers, and adding another stylesheet. I was thinking about removing the overly extended borders from the blogs, but I couldn't decide, so I put it to a vote.</p>
	<p>The vote was unanimous, 4/4 wanted to keep the border. So it is here to stay!</p>
	<p>There are still some improvements I want to make, like a navigation pane on the top, a create blog button with a blog writer, images next to the blogs, dates next to the blogs, and a better dropdown arrow that stands out better.</p>
	<p>However, I don't know how to do these yet.</p>
	<p>The new changes from the recent snapshots after I fixed the divider bloat have already covered up the size that was lost, with an additional 4 kilobytes in size.</p>
	<p>For other parts of the site today, I didn't do as much. I added a blog writer, and updated the firefox account page, but that is pretty much it. However, the site is now shaping into rhe way I want it finally.</p>
	<p>I am bummed about having to go back to school tomorrow, but it might be fun.</p>

	<p>Spring Break is over, and I went back to 11th grade today. The past 2 days I have made significant progress on the website.</p>
	<p>Today, only a few minor improvements were added. Keep in mind, I am juggling over 5 projects at once, I am unable to put all my time and resources into a single project, I juggle a minimum of 4 projects a day.</p>
	<p>This doesn't mean that the development on SNU is poor. How I have done it, is SNU is required work after all the other projects are done, and I can have flexible periods of time to work on it.</p>
	<p>Sometimes, I have large amounts of time, like Saturday and Sunday, and get lots done, other days, I have little time, and can still put effort into it.</p>
	<p>I am planning out a new update in June and I am excited to roll it out.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, I didn't have much time for development today, and I only had small ideas that take less time to add. But I had to add something today, I have a long streak of development on this platform, and I don't want it to die for a second.</p>
	<p>So only a small update today, nothing big, just minor changes. Sorry about this. I hope that tomorrow (or any day in the rest of the week) goes better</p>

	<p>Today was another day of development. Another small update, as I didn't have as much time. Sorry about this, I am just so busy, I can't work on SNU as much as I could</p>
	<p>I am running low on small ideas at the moment, so I am digging through older ones at the moment. One of the older ideas I am introducing is user plans.</p>
	<p>Paying for plans cost money, except for the first 2 (standard, and family) where you can connect up to 20 accounts and manage a network (family plan) or operate as a single user (standard plan)</p>
	<p>The statistics are a work in progress at the moment, and the economy isn't at the point where we can support this yet, it may take several years</p>

	<p>The system is designed to make it so people who upload content and want money for their content can't be a hypocrite and block ads when viewing other peoples content. When you block too many ads (40000) you lose the ability to monetize your content for 6 months.</p>
	<p>This new rule was put into place to protect the SNU economy once it starts. Keep in mind, I am the only person making and managing this site at the moment. It is a lot of work to do this every day, and eventually I am going to need a team of people. Right now, I am just laying down the foundation and ideas.</p>
	<p>Spring Break is almost over and I have wasted so much time during it, because of medication issues, that I really missed out on doing massive improvements to this site. I still got a lot done, however, just not as much as I could.</p>
	<p>Thank you for reading! - Sean P. Myrick</p>

	<H2>SNU developer log day 67</H2>
	<p>Last night, a big part of the site started development: I am finally putting in the designs. Starting off in the blog section, you will notice that the background isn't a solid color anymore, and the text is white instead of black.</p>
	<p>You will also notice some transparent boxes. This is something I have been trying to add to this page for a while, last night I started with the CSS.</p>
	<p>Currently, I have the hyperlink section working fully functional, and I tried putting in a transparent box over a < details > tag, but the box overrode the < details > and now the text won't show up.</p>
	<p>This is a new feature, and it is currently being worked on. Once I get the strategy down, it should spread to all other parts of the blog.</p>
	<p>On a later update that lasted me past 10:00 pm, I realized the text was showing, but it was the same color as the box. So the color was changed, and I spent over 30 minutes applying this to ALL the blogs.</p>
	<p>I have also attached a stylesheet to this page, it is slowly becoming more advanced.</p>
	<p>Today, I have updated the blog page further. I have decided to add a sticky sidebar, comment dividers, and adding another stylesheet. I was thinking about removing the overly extended borders from the blogs, but I couldn't decide, so I put it to a vote.</p>
	<p>The vote was unanimous, 4/4 wanted to keep the border. So it is here to stay!</p>
	<p>There are still some improvements I want to make, like a navigation pane on the top, a create blog button with a blog writer, images next to the blogs, dates next to the blogs, and a better dropdown arrow that stands out better.</p>
	<p>However, I don't know how to do these yet.</p>
	<p>The new changes from the recent snapshots after I fixed the divider bloat have already covered up the size that was lost, with an additional 4 kilobytes in size.</p>
	<p>For other parts of the site today, I didn't do as much. I added a blog writer, and updated the firefox account page, but that is pretty much it. However, the site is now shaping into rhe way I want it finally.</p>
	<p>I am bummed about having to go back to school tomorrow, but it might be fun.</p>

	<H2>SNU developer log day 68</H2>
	<p>Spring Break is over, and I went back to 11th grade today. The past 2 days I have made significant progress on the website.</p>
	<p>Today, only a few minor improvements were added. Keep in mind, I am juggling over 5 projects at once, I am unable to put all my time and resources into a single project, I juggle a minimum of 4 projects a day.</p>
	<p>This doesn't mean that the development on SNU is poor. How I have done it, is SNU is required work after all the other projects are done, and I can have flexible periods of time to work on it.</p>
	<p>Sometimes, I have large amounts of time, like Saturday and Sunday, and get lots done, other days, I have little time, and can still put effort into it.</p>
	<p>I am planning out a new update in June and I am excited to roll it out.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on April 8th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU developer log day 69</H2> 
	<p>Unfortunately, I didn't have much time for development today, and I only had small ideas that take less time to add. But I had to add something today, I have a long streak of development on this platform, and I don't want it to die for a second.</p>
	<p>So only a small update today, nothing big, just minor changes. Sorry about this. I hope that tomorrow (or any day in the rest of the week) goes better</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on April 9th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU developer log day 70</H2>
	<p>Today was another day of development. Another small update, as I didn't have as much time. Sorry about this, I am just so busy, I can't work on SNU as much as I could</p>
	<p>I am running low on small ideas at the moment, so I am digging through older ones at the moment. One of the older ideas I am introducing is user plans.</p>
	<p>Paying for plans cost money, except for the first 2 (standard, and family) where you can connect up to 20 accounts and manage a network (family plan) or operate as a single user (standard plan)</p>
	<p>The statistics are a work in progress at the moment, and the economy isn't at the point where we can support this yet, it may take several years</p>

	<p>Today is finally Friday. So at the moment, not much has been added to SNU, I have had some delays this week, such as bookmarks, hard drive backup (which took 7 hours) updates, side projects, downtime, and stress. Not much was added to SNU, but due to the plan to frequently update and bring big features here at a faster rate, development should pick up again soon.</p>
	<p>To reduce work on the new update, new directories are now being sorted and made in the SNU Milestone 3 Version 6 format. When that update comes out, all other folders will be like this. It will be a lot more organized, and easier to access</p>

	<p>Today was a good day for development. It is finally rhe weekend, and I was able to get some work done on this site. So there was a bad description on why I updated the blog editor yesterday: the blog editor in templateaccount is actual just a prototype, and it was integrated into the template account. I needed to change this and make a separate editor for it. The new editor is improved, and is universl around the site, making the prototype seem week</p>
	<p>So I am planning on taking a staff photo some time this year, and there will be a little joke with it: I will be the only one in the picture. Why? So far, I am the only one working on this site. It is both a joke and reality</p>

	<p>Today is the last day of the weekend. My computers processor has been getting hammered by Scratch 3. I am working on archiving all of my older projects, and due to the bloat on Scratch 3, it is using massive amounts of  memory for simple projects, constantly crashing, and it has been a pain for me. It took me over 2 hours to download a little over 20 projects.</p>
	<p>Due to this, I wasn't able to make much progress on SNU today. I applied a basic update, but nothing special. Development is slow right now because there are so many different projects going at once. I hope to fix these flaws soon</p>

	<p>I hate having to keep writing about my failure on maintaining this site on a daily basis due to school and my 100+ other projects. I have a lot on my mind, and I have a lot of things I transition between. SNU is high priority, but it only comes in as top 5 out of 100+</p>
	<p>I "patched" a hole in SNU security today, about a page of HTML links where one link could be malicious. Unfortunately, I couldn't really fix this. People will just have to be cautious. I can't go back and fix 100+ files, it is history. There is now a security warning, and security tab for later builds, hopefully that is enough, I can't cover older builds. I am talking about my Firefox account page.</p>
	<p>The big update in June is going to be the big thing. Right now, I am just going throughs several transitions. One thing that really stunted development today was Mozillas introduction of Python into their web browser.</p>
	<p>I am both very happy about this, but at the same time, very disappointed.</p>
	<p>One of my earlier projects, a calculator, relied on Python. Now I have realized that anyone can manipulate this over time, and I don't have the resources to restart that project, even though I spent 2 months on it. Eventually, I will get back to it when I get more control of my life.</p>
	<p>For now, have another basic SNU update, just to keep the ball rolling.</p>

	<p>The new video players for SNU are coming along pretty well. I kind of wish I could add the thumbnails for the film plaza (Movies and TV) section, but I can't really add anything for that yet.</p>
	<p>Along with miniature updates to core features, I have added massive improvements to the new video player. Core features didn't change as much compared to the other new features today. Today is also Friday, and tomorrow is the first day of the Weekend. Time today I had was limited, so hopefully I can push out some great big updates in the next 2 days.</p>
	<p>I am 9 days ahead of archival on my Scratch archive, so there will be enough for the weekend to go without very frequent project downloads, however I will still do some downloads.</p>
	<p>Today was a good day for innovative development, but not for daily blogs and such (content-quantity wise)</p>

	<p>I didn't get as much done as I anticipated. However, I made some progress with listing the settings for the video players, updating documentation, and locking down the blog editor. Judging by today, tomorrow might not be that great for development either. I tried my best at least.</p>
	<p>I had a lot of side projects and waiting today, and I am glad I was able to even push out an update. The site is really coming along.</p>

	<p>This weekend didn't go as well as I thought. I also made a new commitment that is going to be hard to follow. Currently, most video sharing sites have videos between 144p and 4320p quality. I have gone ahead, and made several additional qualities that span from 64p to 300000p (the max dimensions in Adobe PhotoShop 2015) I don't even know if HTML5 even supports media that size yet, it is going to be a while before I am able to implement it.</p>
	<p>Another issue is how much it would take up on a server. Just a single frame of this would be a terabyte in size. Right now I am struggling with 1 terabyte of memory on my main device. It is going to take time. The other big issue of this commitment is how advanced an algorithm required it will be to do this. I don't know how I am going to regulate it, there is still a lot of work to go.</p>
	<p>I am also putting in work into a video editor. Right now, I am focusing on the layout. It is going to take some thought on how to make a web video editor.</p>
	<p>I did some basic updates to the documentation of several pages today. I was thinking about adding in indexes for the developer log to June 14th, but it seemed like it would take too much time at the moment, and I have a lot of other projects to get through, so I stopped at a generous 100 (up to May 10th 2019)</p>
	<p>Along with all of this, today was a good day for development. I start school up again tomorrow. So I am getting further with my Scratch archive project, and I am close to a closing point, so it might free up an additional 2 hours a day for me. Either that time will be allocated for a break, SNU, or another project</p>

	<p>Today, I started school back up. Today I made the decision to start development on the 5th mode of my website, which is a pornographic mode.</p> 
	<p>That's right, I have decided that it is finally time to work on the porn section of this site. For now, I will only be working on the layout. I am not going to repeat the error of the Google sites edition.</p>
	<p> really want to move past that, I am still embarrased by most of the content I put there. It doesn't reflect the modern me, and it is even worse than what my misunderstanding of life was in my Scratch era (2015-2017)</p>
	<p>There will be strong restrictions against children under the age of consent to enter this part of the site, and there will be moderation rules here as well</p>
	<p>Along with this, there were a few minor changes to the site.</p>

	<p>I did a basic update today. I released a redirect for the new adult section of SNU with very crucial information for parents and organizations. I also did some smaller updates around the site, such as documentation.</p>
	<p>Just a small update today. Nothing that big. I am saving that for another day.</p>

	<p>I am taking a break from development today, as I am stuck. I had an overflow of assignments, and I want to dedicate time to other projects today. So today for SNU, all I did was update the developer and update logs.</p>
	<p>When I get back, I should have some new ideas for SNU that will make it really great again.</p>

	<H1>SNU developer log day 78</H1>
	<p>Today was a decent day for development. I got some new ideas down, and put a little effort into the site. I found a big error I made with my blogs, I had the 75th developer log repeated twice. I wasn't missing a day. I reverted the issue.</p>

	<H1>SNU developer log day 79</H1>
	<p>The new video players for SNU are coming along pretty well. I kind of wish I could add the thumbnails for the film plaza (Movies and TV) section, but I can't really add anything for that yet.</p>
	<p>Along with miniature updates to core features, I have added massive improvements to the new video player. Core features didn't change as much compared to the other new features today. Today is also Friday, and tomorrow is the first day of the Weekend. Time today I had was limited, so hopefully I can push out some great big updates in the next 2 days.</p>
	<p>I am 9 days ahead of archival on my Scratch archive, so there will be enough for the weekend to go without very frequent project downloads, however I will still do some downloads.</p>
	<p>Today was a good day for innovative development, but not for daily blogs and such (content-quantity wise)</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on April 19th 2019</p>
	<<H1>SNU developer log day 80</H1>
	<p>I didn't get as much done as I anticipated. However, I made some progress with listing the settings for the video players, updating documentation, and locking down the blog editor. Judging by today, tomorrow might not be that great for development either. I tried my best at least.</p>
	<p>I had a lot of side projects and waiting today, and I am glad I was able to even push out an update. The site is really coming along.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on April 20th 2019</p>
	<H1>SNU developer log day 81</H1>
	<p>This weekend didn't go as well as I thought. I also made a new commitment that is going to be hard to follow. Currently, most video sharing sites have videos between 144p and 4320p quality. I have gone ahead, and made several additional qualities that span from 64p to 300000p (the max dimensions in Adobe PhotoShop 2015) I don't even know if HTML5 even supports media that size yet, it is going to be a while before I am able to implement it.</p>
	<p>Another issue is how much it would take up on a server. Just a single frame of this would be a terabyte in size. Right now I am struggling with 1 terabyte of memory on my main device. It is going to take time. The other big issue of this commitment is how advanced an algorithm required it will be to do this. I don't know how I am going to regulate it, there is still a lot of work to go.</p>
	<p>I am also putting in work into a video editor. Right now, I am focusing on the layout. It is going to take some thought on how to make a web video editor.</p>
	<p>I did some basic updates to the documentation of several pages today. I was thinking about adding in indexes for the developer log to June 14th, but it seemed like it would take too much time at the moment, and I have a lot of other projects to get through, so I stopped at a generous 100 (up to May 10th 2019)</p>
	<p>Along with all of this, today was a good day for development. I start school up again tomorrow. So I am getting further with my Scratch archive project, and I am close to a closing point, so it might free up an additional 2 hours a day for me. Either that time will be allocated for a break, SNU, or another project</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on April 21st 2019</p>
	<H1>SNU developer log day 82</H1>
	<p>Today, I started school back up. Today I made the decision to start development on the 5th mode of my website, which is a pornographic mode.</p> 
	<p>That's right, I have decided that it is finally time to work on the porn section of this site. For now, I will only be working on the layout. I am not going to repeat the error of the Google sites edition.</p>
	<p> really want to move past that, I am still embarrased by most of the content I put there. It doesn't reflect the modern me, and it is even worse than what my misunderstanding of life was in my Scratch era (2015-2017)</p>
	<p>There will be strong restrictions against children under the age of consent to enter this part of the site, and there will be moderation rules here as well</p>
	<p>Along with this, there were a few minor changes to the site.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on April 22nd 2019</p>
	<H1>SNU developer log day 83</H1>
	<p>I did a basic update today. I released a redirect for the new adult section of SNU with very crucial information for parents and organizations. I also did some smaller updates around the site, such as documentation.</p>
	<p>Just a small update today. Nothing that big. I am saving that for another day.</p>

	<p>I am coming back strong on development after my 1 day break. I have 2 full pages of ideas for this site, along with a bunch of new features that will be coming over time. I will go over the 2 main ones here:</p>
	<p><b>The SNU Engine</b></p>
	<p>I am basing this off of my first thoughts of what I think the MediaWiki Engine does. This engine will be written in Python and will be used to develop features for SNU, port it to and from other sites, and manage the site better. The engine will start development in M3V6</p>

	<HR>
	<p>Along with these, over 30 other new features have been thought of and I will slowly recreate them</p>
	<p>Development also went well today, due to all the free time I had.</p>

	<p>Despite today being the first day of the weekend, unfortunately I didn't add as much as I originally wanted to. There were some issues today, like family member sickness, distractios, waking up later (8:15 am) distractions, other projects, and difficulty focusing</p>
	<p>For now, I will continue to apply standard updates, and add new ideas. The idea board is getting pretty big. Today, I didn't really know what to add. So I brought in a few ideas, and updated several pages</p>

	<p>I didn't add in the best new features yesterday. I mostly added the dark and restricted ones. Today, I didn't add much. I improved a lot of pages, and added new updates, but no new features. Today is the last day of the weekend, and it has been difficult trying to make time for this project.</p>
	<p>I added my standard Sunday update today, with some new features, but no vast improvements. Maybe tomorrow will be better.</p>

	<p>Today I had another surge of ideas for the website, with 15 new ideas in a single day. I have now contributed over 100 ideas to my own sites idea board. Tomorrow is the 100th day of development, and I have a day off, so I might do something special for it.</p>
	<p>However, today was just another documentation update day, and a day where I added new ideas (totaling 109 at the moment) I am still really excited for the June 14th 2019 update.</p>
	<p>I can't believe it has already been 98 days since I started writing this site. I might do some salvage work this weekend to find some of my older HTML prototypes, but they might not get implemented immediately</p>

	<p>Today is day 100 of development, and I wasn't able to really do much. I only had 1 idea for the site today that I could put on the idea board, but I am starting development on the 3D mode.</p>
	<p>The 3D mode is now being built off of WebGL. Other than that, documentation updates today</p>

	<p>Nothing special happened for the 100 day of development. I am hoping I can do something special for the 1 year anniversary. It was actually really easy to fix the 3D cube. All I had to do was relocate the resource files. I don't see why I didn't figure that out immediately, maybe I was just too excited.</p>
	<p>The SNU 3D cube will be a 3D test example. I am working on getting all the logos onto it.</p>
	<p>On with todays development, I was able to add in several new ideas, along with the normal documentation improvements. I finally finished a huge part of another project today.</p>

	<p>SNU has taught me a lot about web development. This site dates back to the first days of my advanced web development. I originally didn't think I was going to be a web developer, and just a programmer, but now I am both.</p>
	<p>Today is Sunday, and I was able to apply a mini update. I updated the documentation a bit, and did some 3D tests. That is it.</p>

	<p>I promised a lot over the weekend, but then everything went differently. I am going to keep development going, as this site is the proof of my knowledge of HTML ever since I started learning more of it.</p>
	<p>To think all it took was to play around with internal hyperlinks that I managed to create all of this.</p>
	<p>Today, I started school back up, but I was able to put out more documentation updates.</p>

	<p>I don't feel like SNU 3.0.6 will be significant enough as it is currently planned. I have to really start preparing for the future. There is going to have to be a way to send/store data effectively, and it might require several pages to have to be rewritten.</p>
	<p>I might have to take certain moves to ensure as little rewriting as possible. I also am wondering how I will balance the 2D and 3D systems. Lately, all I have been doing is updating the update log, and developer log, and added 1, a few, or several ideas to the staff idea board.</p>
	<p>This should buy me time and cause less rewriting. I don't have enough significant features that I can add easily. Most of the features on the idea board are for when the site becomes more advanced, and I am going to have to do a lot more research first</p>
	<p>Updates will continue like this, maybe up until the June update. I have created enough ideas for this site to make it thrive, but more ideas increase the chance.</p>
	<p>As an extra to get something else easy done today, I added in the blank template for the update log up to June 14th 2019 (the day of the update)</p>

	<p>Today was a dark and dreary day outside. I got several ideas down, but only 1 that I can really use at the moment (licensing) today was another documentaton day. It has been rainy outside today, and this weather brings my mood down a bit.</p>
	<p>I have other projects that I had to work on as well, but I still got my daily dose of SNU development completed. Big changes are to be expected in the June 14th 2019 update, which is in 30 days.</p> 
	<p>Content-wise, there has been a head-on battle for snapshot counts between the update log and developer log, both soon to reach 70 snapshots. However, the idea board is taking off due to its excessive development.</p>
	<p>These statistics don't mean much, but they can be interesting for site development history.</p>
	<p>Tomorrow, the developer log will get a good update, as I will fill in the weekly blog.</p>
	<p>File size on the developer log is getting a little big now, but memory usage isn't too much of a concern yet. At the moment, the blog takes up 257.18 kilobytes (257,187 bytes) of memory</p>

	<p>So on a different project yesterday I punctured a nerve on my left arm. It recovered quickly. That project received a lot of effort yesterday, and SNU didn't. SNU will get lots of improvements starting on either June 14th or June 15th 2019</p>
	<p>However, today, I was able to work on 4 different parts of the site. Why? It is Sunday, and it is the day where I update the Firefox account page with new links, and a picture of this weeks progress.</p>
	<p>It also became the 4th page series on this site to receive the 300 snapshot feature. Other than that, I added a few new ideas, and updated the documentation. It was a decent update. The site is really coming along.</p>

	<p>Today I had more ideas for the site. I also noticed something that should have been changed a long time ago: the title for the SNU developer log has been "Sean Patrick Myrick - Staff profile" the reason? I forget to change the title on new pages,</p>
	<p>Today I was finally able to fix that, and I chose to name it what it really is: the official SNU developer log.</p>
	<p>There is an upcoming break day where I might not work on the site, as I am going on a trip to Spokane. I will try to work on the site, but I can't make any guarantees. There are 24 days left until the big 3.0.6 update, and I will continue updating the idea board and the site documentation until then.</p>
	<p>This site is doing really well, and it marks a lot of progress in my knowledge of web development. I can now officially call myself a web developer, alongside my programmer title. I never thought that I would be a web developer, I thought I would just be a programmer. All due to experimenting with hyperlinks.</p>

	<p>Today is day 112 of development, only 23 days left until the 3.0.6 update. I have a lot to talk about today, due to some ideas, experimentations, and events.</p>
	<p>Today was an enhanced documentation day, with some new ideas, and a good chunk of new documentation to explain the present and future of this site and its development.</p>
	<p>I did a little experiment yesterday with a site favicon. I got a low resolution favicon working, but I haven't gotten the official SNU logo made into a favicon for privacy, security, and copyright reasons.</p>
	<p>It is too early to leak the brand name this short in development. The good thing is though, now I know how to apply a favicon to a page. It is really easy. I don't know why I hold off small things like this for such long periods of time.</p>
	<p>The favicon testing is now listed under the HTML test references page. I don't use this section as much as I should, with 3.0.6, I plan to make it more easily accessible and organized, so it can serve as a better reference.</p>
	<p>So a little update, I decided not to include this in yesterday's blog because it had enough in it, but I found out that my trip to Spokane will also be a trip to Chelan and I will stay multiple notes. Hopefully, I can get some progress done, as 3 days with no progress isn't a good thing.</p>
	<p>I will try to arrange something.</p>

	<p>I took some leisure time for myself to relax and think of site ideas, then do some work on projects. Today was another good day for documentation, with 3 new blogs, 4 new ideas, and some minor changes to the site.</p>
	<p>I am slowly getting a lot done.</p>

	<p>Today was a little bit of a slow day today. I only added in 1 idea as I am running low right now, and I also have to make it possible for me to implement all these ideas in the future.</p>
	<p>There have been some memory issues with my laptop that I develop SNU on. I can't keep doing this the way I am doing. I am considering some cutbacks. </p>
	<p>For example, I am considering stopping the updates to my bookmark system, as the size is getting ridiculous. This is taking up over 32 Megabytes a day, which over time really builds up.</p>
	<p>The cut will take place sometime between May 26th 2019 and June 14th 2019</p>
	<p>Other than that, there were brief documentation updates, and I am now preparing data to transfer over to the new blog for the site owner (Sean) as the blogs are part of the sites history.</p>
	<p>Also, the idea board is getting close to surpassing the developer log in the count of lines of code</p>

	<p>Today was a slow day for development on the main build of the site. I only updated documentation, and added 1 idea</p>
	<p>What I spent a lot of time on today is the new Virtual Machine Engine I am making. I am forking it from the internet archive's emularity engine, and it is going to be a full-on virtual machine tool for online and offline use.</p>
	<p>I am laying the foundation for it today, and getting its ideas ready.</p>
	<p>So not much was done to the regular site today.</p>

	<p>I have been busy today, but I have also had procrastination issues. I have a lot of work to do, but I keep getting distracted. Luckily at 3:00 pm, I was able to focus. Today wasn't the best day for site development.</p>
	<p>I did very brief documentation updates, and I added an idea, but it was barely anything. I really need the date to become June 14th so that I can make the big update and give this project a soul again.</p>

	<p>If you are reading this on a snapshot from May 31st 2019, then that means I was able to apply an update today during the start of my vacation. I woke up early to get work done today before the trip.</p>
	<p>I might add more features later today If I can. I just have 2 more days of this vacation after today, hopefully I am still able to put out content on those days and further the development of this site</p>
	<p>I did a small documentation update today, with new updates to engines.</p>

	<p>If you are reading this on the 1st of June on a June 1st snapshot, then day 2 of development during the vacation is going good.</p> 
	<p>I have decided on 1 minor change in the name of SNU 3.0.6, like a side version number. </p>
	<p>Since this is the first series of the site that is being written without a template like Google sites, so it will also be referred to as C1.0.6 the C can hold the 3 that might not have meant to be.</p> 
	<p>It doesn't matter which way you call the version number, they both mean the same thing. Anyway, standard development again today, and it will continue this way up until 3.0.6/C1.0.6</p>
	<p>I have been having a lot of time in the apartment in this vacation, so I was able to get work done today. However, I took a lot of time to do homework and relax today. I still put out a brief documentation update that also prepares the idea board for usage throughout June</p>
	<p>The idea board now has the most lines of code out of any page I wrote</p>

	<p>Well, I managed to update the site every day during my vacation. The site is getting a lot better, and a few new innovative ideas were added to the idea list today, such as a full site dictation mode, custom loading signs, and buffer length.</p>
	<p>I updated the site late in the day today, as I didn't have time in the morning to do so, as I had to pack up and leave and go back to Walla Walla from Chelan. I had a nice vacation, but it was a little short, and I didn't get outside much, just a bunch of work and meetings.</p>
	<p>Only 12 days until the big 3.0.6/C1.0.6 update takes place. I am really excited to start adding in content again. Today I did a default update to the site, featuring the average Sunday bookmark update, and improved documentation.</p>
	<p>Starting June 15th 2019, I will try and put in content updates with things other than the usual, something new. I have enough ideas stockpiled, it might last me into the 3.0.7/C1.0.7 update.</p>
	<p>That is what happened today, I start school back up tomorrow, but development should continue to be normal.</p>

	<p>Today, I added brief documentation. The new update will happen in 11 days. End of support for SNU 3.0.5 will happen on June 14th 2019, and support for SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 will start on June 14th 2019.</p>

	<p>I have almost drained all the ideas from my SNU idea pool at the moment. It took work today to come up with an idea, 7 minutes of thinking, normally ideas come to me and I don't have to try and think about it. I am running low on ideas to add, but there are already so many ideas, that it doesn't really matter that much. I might just run out of things that a browser is capable of at the moment.</p>
	<p>Luckily, some of these ideas are going to start being applied starting in the middle of June with the SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 update which I have been mentioning excessively in the update log. There just isn't much to talk about anymore. Don't worry, once I start implementing ideas again, it should be up and booming again.</p>
	<p>Today, I applied a basic documentation update, with 1 new idea, and 2 pages updated, with a total of 3 snapshots. Pretty average day in the ending period of the SNU 3.0.5 product lifespan.</p>
	<p>Support is ending on 3.0.5 on June 14th 2019, and extended support may begin in the future if requested enough. It won't matter much, they are just archival points.</p>
	<p>I am really sorry that I don't just put out entire updates daily instead of as snapshots, but that would take up a ridiculous amount of memory. I am already having enough issues with storage as it is.</p>
	<p>The site will be thriving again in late June, as I have mentioned many times. Site development is going well.</p>

	<p>My idea bank is acting unusual. The amount of ideas has been pretty low lately, and it picked up a little bit again today. So far this week, it hasn't been very good. On June 4th, I averaged at 2 ideas per day for this month, and on June 5th, I averaged at 2.2 ideas a day per month.</p> 
	<p>I came up with some big ideas today, and thanks to some leverage from Google messing up on a feature on their site (abbreviating subscriber counts to prevent live subscriber count videos and livestreams) it gave me 2 new ideas for my site on how I will manage this feature, along with additional ideas, such as a full on 3D printer studio online. I haven't really seen any sites that do this yet, I could be the first to do it.</p>
	<p>That idea was inspired by working with 3D printers today. It is a pretty difficult goal to go for, but when I get a team together, anything might be possible.</p>
	<p>Other than new prominent ideas, I did do average documentation updates to the site today. There is only 9 more days until the SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 update, so I will say it again, new content will start to be added in on a regular basis, and there will be more than just documentation updates.</p>
	<p>I have enough ideas stockpiled that I could keep the renovations going strong for quite some time. Some other ones are too advanced to do by myself, and will require a team of people. I also added some templates to the blog for a few days after the release of SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 and that concludes the first 17 weeks of development.</p>

	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on June 3rd 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU developer log day 125</H2>
	<p>I have almost drained all the ideas from my SNU idea pool at the moment. It took work today to come up with an idea, 7 minutes of thinking, normally ideas come to me and I don't have to try and think about it. I am running low on ideas to add, but there are already so many ideas, that it doesn't really matter that much. I might just run out of things that a browser is capable of at the moment.</p>
	<p>Luckily, some of these ideas are going to start being applied starting in the middle of June with the SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 update which I have been mentioning excessively in the update log. There just isn't much to talk about anymore. Don't worry, once I start implementing ideas again, it should be up and booming again.</p>
	<p>Today, I applied a basic documentation update, with 1 new idea, and 2 pages updated, with a total of 3 snapshots. Pretty average day in the ending period of the SNU 3.0.5 product lifespan.</p>
	<p>Support is ending on 3.0.5 on June 14th 2019, and extended support may begin in the future if requested enough. It won't matter much, they are just archival points.</p>
	<p>I am really sorry that I don't just put out entire updates daily instead of as snapshots, but that would take up a ridiculous amount of memory. I am already having enough issues with storage as it is.</p>
	<p>The site will be thriving again in late June, as I have mentioned many times. Site development is going well.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on June 4th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU developer log day 126</H2>
	<p>My idea bank is acting unusual. The amount of ideas has been pretty low lately, and it picked up a little bit again today. So far this week, it hasn't been very good. On June 4th, I averaged at 2 ideas per day for this month, and on June 5th, I averaged at 2.2 ideas a day per month.</p> 
	<p>I came up with some big ideas today, and thanks to some leverage from Google messing up on a feature on their site (abbreviating subscriber counts to prevent live subscriber count videos and livestreams) it gave me 2 new ideas for my site on how I will manage this feature, along with additional ideas, such as a full on 3D printer studio online. I haven't really seen any sites that do this yet, I could be the first to do it.</p>
	<p>That idea was inspired by working with 3D printers today. It is a pretty difficult goal to go for, but when I get a team together, anything might be possible.</p>
	<p>Other than new prominent ideas, I did do average documentation updates to the site today. There is only 9 more days until the SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 update, so I will say it again, new content will start to be added in on a regular basis, and there will be more than just documentation updates.</p>
	<p>I have enough ideas stockpiled that I could keep the renovations going strong for quite some time. Some other ones are too advanced to do by myself, and will require a team of people. I also added some templates to the blog for a few days after the release of SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 and that concludes the first 17 weeks of development.</p>

	<p>I have spotted a huge error. I have been saying that the next version will be 3.0.6. It will actually be 3.0.5/C1.0.5. I messed up badly on the version number. Luckily it is only the version number. The contents of the update will remain the same.</p>
	<p>Huge error on my part, I really should have noticed it sooner. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused. I noticed this error while working on the update log yesterday. I should have noticed it a lot sooner.</p>
	<p>Today, I finished my work early, and had a lot of extra time. I am working on a khan academy module for the site. Today, I updated documentation, and added 2 new ideas. That is it.</p>

	<p>Slow day for development today. I worked mostly on other projects. I recovered some old media for the site, including an outdated flash ad component. I plan to add it into the SNU 3.0.5/C1.0.5 package.</p>
	<p>Not that much today, just documentation, and a resource heavy option (certified slow for 400 MBP internet and below) known as a SuperWiki</p>
	<p>I only have 2 and a half more days of school after today, and shortly after that, the big update is coming.</p>

	<p>I did a small update today. There are some other projects I have to do today, and I woke up late today, so I don't have as much time for this site today.</p>
	<p>There is less than 1 week left until the big 3.0.5/C1.0.5 update. Development will get a lot better again.</p>

	<p>Today, I just added an average Sunday update. I did the weekly update to the bookmark system, added a few ideas, and updated documentation. I am really excited to start development again on June 14th.</p>
	<p>The big update is coming in less than 6 days now. 5 days to go. The site is going to become active again, and maintenance will be a lot better. Just 5 more days of this, and then SNU 3.0.4 will be unsupported and I get to move on to the next milestone.</p>

	<p>One of the first minor changes I have in mind for the next SNU update is increasing each big pages snapshot repository from 300 to 500. It is early at the moment, but it is fine to be ready early.</p>
	<p>I am entering my last week of 11th grade at WA-HI today, today is a half day for me, as I don't have a solid 7th period. After today, I just have to go for 2 more days, then I will graduate from 11th grade, and I can begin my summer updates.</p>
	<p>I am hoping to do as much as I can to this site over the summer. If I can utilize my time correctly, I can overhaul this site into something even greater, and get lots (or even a decent chunk) of progress into its vast array of elements and features.</p>
	<p>However, I am balancing multiple projects, such as my bookmark hobby, Journaling, and Scratch archive project. I will still be able to do work. </p>
	<p>Today on the site, I did a small update before school. I updated the documentation on the usual pages. I am preparing a speech at the moment as well.</p>
	<p>There is 1 problem I noticed for continued development on the site after June 14th 2019: the save location.</p>
	<p>I am going to really have to make sure I save in the 3.0.5 root and not the 3.0.4 root. Hopefully I can get past that.</p>
	<p>It is all half days at school this week, so I will have extra time for other projects.</p>

	<p>Without this year, SNU might not have even taken off this far. Over the summer, I will continue to build off of it and improve it. I have a lot planned for this site this summer, and I have to take it one day at a time.</p>
	<p>Today was one of the final 3 days of average development in the SNU 3.0.4 phase, and also the third to last day of development of SNU 3.0.4. On June 14th 2019, one day after the last day of school, I am moving to SNU 3.0.5/C1.0.5</p>
	<p>So for now, I did some documentation updates, and added a special blog for the next update, and a blog explaining the history of this user account so far.</p>
	<p>Site development is going to get good again on Thursday or Friday. Be prepared!</p>

	<p>The new update is tomorrow yet I have had the worst 36 hours I have ever had with productivity this year. I have had 12 hours to do work today, yet it has taken me 10 just to get this far. I have been having issues focusing today, a lot has been distracting me, and I just haven't been able to focus. I was able to pull through in the end.</p>
	<p>I am not going to add the week 19 compilation due to time concerns today, but I am going to copy over the SNU 3.0.4 codebase into the SNU 3.0.5 codebase after I finish with my bookmarks right after this. This was also my first day of summer break, and it isn't going too well.</p>
	<p>This is hopefully the last rushed update to the site today for a while, I am going to try and add new features, if I can be productive again. Development is going to come strong again tomorrow (hopefully)</p>

	<p>So SNU 3.0.5 is now here, but I am having some huge issues. I didn't realize that the current branch of SNU is over 40 gigabytes in size, and that really stressed me out, as now I am down to my last 260 gigabytes on my laptop. Also, I am going through some severe burnout right now.</p>
	<p>I am trying to put out a quality update, but I am just unable to. Unfortunately, I might have to take a break from site development. There were no new ideas today, and thus the streak has ended. This site still has so much work, and I am not making the biggest impact yet, and it is really stressing me out</p>
	<p>So just minimal updates today. I will try again tomorrow.</p>

	<p>I have been having some serious procrastination issues for the last 3 days. I have finally come over them today. It felt like I lost my ability to work, and now I am up and running again. I have started to do some changes for the SNU 3.0.5 update, today, I did some crucial changes.</p>
	<p>For example, I have finally created a new user for my personal blogs that aren't related to SNU development. They are now under SeanPatrickMyrick blogs. I have moved out all the unrelated blogs to that page.</p>
	<p>I have also fixed a bug that has been affecting the blog page since its introduction to transparent dialog boxes: I have fixed the margin and border issues. All the transparent boxes are compact and organized now. I have enabled some of the planned SNU 3.0.5 blogs, and did more changes to the site.</p>
	<p>I have reorganized folders and their references, so the site would be more organized. Summer development is now getting good.</p>
	<p>I had to make some big sacrifices, such as dropping Scratch archive work from proprietary to "do as you please" and temporarily end development on the bookmark system to save time and space.</p>

	<p>Today was another good day for development. I wrapped up some ideas I didn't get to yesterday, and fixed another bug, which unfortunately introduced another bug. Still a decent day for development, but not the best.</p>
	<p>It is better than just a plain standard documentation update again. It technically still is a documentation update, but it still adds more content.</p>

	<p>So I wasn't prepared for today. My laptop is really screwing up, severe memory (RAM) usage was discovered from a recent update that is significantly slowing down my computer and reducing my battery life. I have been monitoring it today. There have been several technical faults, and I wasn't able to work on my website for a while.</p>
	<p>So the background not showing up in snapshots bug was already fixed, I just clicked on an early build by accident. I played around with the page to find more bugs in the new layout, and some still exist. The new 2 bugs I noticed were that the blog homepage and blog editor buttons don't work in snapshot mode, which is expected due to it trying to reach a file in a nonexistant path. I will fix this tomorrow, but I am really tired of having to add new buttons so that features work in both the snapshots and normal builds. When I find an easy efficient way for the browser to just do something like:</p>
	<p>try:</p>
	<p>normal-version.html</p>
	<p>else:</p>
	<p>snapshot-version.html</p>
	<p>Just an example, that script syntax may not work in any current programming language. Today, I spent the day trying to find alternate equipment and monitoring my RAM, Disk and CPU usage when doing very simple things. Off topic from the site, but there was also a memory leak in Firefox that contributed to this.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, no good update roday, just a minimalistic documentation update.</p>

	<p>I have been having issues managing the site lately. I tried to update the site more last night, but I couldn't find anything else that I could do in a short period of time, and I got distracted with other things.</p>
	<p>Other than that, 2 times in the past 4 days I have forgotten to create snapshots for the update log (June 16th 2019 and June 18th 2019) and I had to redo a bunch of incorrect numbers.</p>
	<p>I did some work on documentation as usual, and I couldn't find anything I could update again. I am doing more research on CSS and JS as I am really limited at the moment.</p>
	<p>I also did a few minor tweaks, such as fixing some links, removing extra characters, and more.</p>

	<p>This is hopefully the last rushed update to the site today for a while, I am going to try and add new features, if I can be productive again. Development is going to come strong again tomorrow (hopefully)</p>
	<p>Today is the final day of support for SNU 3.0.4. Extended support may be added in the future.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on June 13th 2019</p>
	<H1>SNU developer log day 135</H1>
	<p>So SNU 3.0.5 is now here, but I am having some huge issues. I didn't realize that the current branch of SNU is over 40 gigabytes in size, and that really stressed me out, as now I am down to my last 260 gigabytes on my laptop. Also, I am going through some severe burnout right now.</p>
	<p>I am trying to put out a quality update, but I am just unable to. Unfortunately, I might have to take a break from site development. There were no new ideas today, and thus the streak has ended. This site still has so much work, and I am not making the biggest impact yet, and it is really stressing me out</p>
	<p>So just minimal updates today. I will try again tomorrow.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on June 14th 2019</p>
	<H1>SNU developer log day 136</H1>
	<p>I have been having some serious procrastination issues for the last 3 days. I have finally come over them today. It felt like I lost my ability to work, and now I am up and running again. I have started to do some changes for the SNU 3.0.5 update, today, I did some crucial changes.</p>
	<p>For example, I have finally created a new user for my personal blogs that aren't related to SNU development. They are now under SeanPatrickMyrick blogs. I have moved out all the unrelated blogs to that page.</p>
	<p>I have also fixed a bug that has been affecting the blog page since its introduction to transparent dialog boxes: I have fixed the margin and border issues. All the transparent boxes are compact and organized now. I have enabled some of the planned SNU 3.0.5 blogs, and did more changes to the site.</p>
	<p>I have reorganized folders and their references, so the site would be more organized. Summer development is now getting good.</p>
	<p>I had to make some big sacrifices, such as dropping Scratch archive work from proprietary to "do as you please" and temporarily end development on the bookmark system to save time and space.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on June 15th 2019</p>
	<H1>SNU developer log day 137</H1>
	<p>Today was another good day for development. I wrapped up some ideas I didn't get to yesterday, and fixed another bug, which unfortunately introduced another bug. Still a decent day for development, but not the best.</p>
	<p>It is better than just a plain standard documentation update again. It technically still is a documentation update, but it still adds more content.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on June 16th 2019</p>
	<H1>SNU developer log day 138</H1>
	<p>So I wasn't prepared for today. My laptop is really screwing up, severe memory (RAM) usage was discovered from a recent update that is significantly slowing down my computer and reducing my battery life. I have been monitoring it today. There have been several technical faults, and I wasn't able to work on my website for a while.</p>
	<p>So the background not showing up in snapshots bug was already fixed, I just clicked on an early build by accident. I played around with the page to find more bugs in the new layout, and some still exist. The new 2 bugs I noticed were that the blog homepage and blog editor buttons don't work in snapshot mode, which is expected due to it trying to reach a file in a nonexistant path. I will fix this tomorrow, but I am really tired of having to add new buttons so that features work in both the snapshots and normal builds. When I find an easy efficient way for the browser to just do something like:</p>
	<p>try:</p>
	<p>normal-version.html</p>
	<p>else:</p>
	<p>snapshot-version.html</p>
	<p>Just an example, that script syntax may not work in any current programming language. Today, I spent the day trying to find alternate equipment and monitoring my RAM, Disk and CPU usage when doing very simple things. Off topic from the site, but there was also a memory leak in Firefox that contributed to this.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, no good update roday, just a minimalistic documentation update.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on June 17th 2019</p>
	<H1>SNU developer log day 139</H1>
	<p>I tried to work on a better update for today. I brought back development on the idea board, continued to work out 404 errors in the new directory tree layout, updated a bunch of off numbers, updated documentation, and more.</p>
	<p>I am getting back into my work routine all the way again. It has been a tough struggle, but I am almost there.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on June 18th 2019</p>
	<H1>SNU developer log day 140</H1>
	<p>I have been having issues managing the site lately. I tried to update the site more last night, but I couldn't find anything else that I could do in a short period of time, and I got distracted with other things.</p>
	<p>Other than that, 2 times in the past 4 days I have forgotten to create snapshots for the update log (June 16th 2019 and June 18th 2019) and I had to redo a bunch of incorrect numbers.</p>
	<p>I did some work on documentation as usual, and I couldn't find anything I could update again. I am doing more research on CSS and JS as I am really limited at the moment.</p>
	<p>I also did a few minor tweaks, such as fixing some links, removing extra characters, and more.</p>

	<p>Today was a better day with site development. Unfortunately, I ran out of good ideas again, and it might take a while to come up with more.</p>
	<p>I tried to get more done to make up for yesterday, yet it still doesn't feel like enough. It doesn't feel like I am making much of an impact. There is still so much more work to do.</p>
	<p>Today I started a crucial process of making web generator scripts that will generate updates. This part of the site is going to be written in Python, my preferred programming language (while HTML5 is my preferred markup language)</p>
	<p>I also did some updates to other pages and updated documentation. Development is getting better, but I am still below 0.1% to the point where I can publically present it and announce it.</p>

	<p>Very small update today, as I didn't have much time for the site. I made a change to the site this morning that is significant in its development: I just couldn't find the time today.

	<p>Right now, the only functionality that PHP is bringing the site is traversing links within buttons. This is impossible with JavaScript, and even if I tried, it would be a massive security risk.</p>

	<p>So I forgot to finalize the update last night. I got lazy and did other things last night. Today, I did some more updates to the site, but less PHP research unfortunately. I am going to try and redo an older page that was one of the best beginning pages: legends of the internet.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the legends part is now going to be a subsection, it will be part of the SNU internet museum. Also, I did a major update to the ideaboard today, along with some other documentation changes. The site is still improving.</p>

	<p>Along with my PHP tutorials and lessons today, I was also able to put out a bigger update than yesterday. Some prominent features were started, such as the account setup tool, and the create server tool</p>
	<p>I might continue learning PHP more intensively tomorrow, and I might also be able to put out an effective update with it.</p>
	<p>Other than that, documentation and test files were created today.</p>

	<H2>SNU developer log day 153</H2>
	<p>So I forgot to finalize the update last night. I got lazy and did other things last night. Today, I did some more updates to the site, but less PHP research unfortunately. I am going to try and redo an older page that was one of the best beginning pages: legends of the internet.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the legends part is now going to be a subsection, it will be part of the SNU internet museum. Also, I did a major update to the ideaboard today, along with some other documentation changes. The site is still improving.</p> 
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on July 2nd 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU developer log day 154</H2>
	<p>I put out a ton of individual updates today, but overall nothing big. I woke up really late today, and didn't have as much time for development. However, I still got a lot of progress on the Amish Easter egg page</p>
	<p>Other than that, it was just a documentation update, and I took a break.</p>

	<p>I have been putting out pretty big updates lately. They are big, but at the same time small. It is just heavy work on other features. It has destroyed my feeling of productivity a little bit though. </p>
	<p>Some of the features that were updated aren't vital, like all the updates to the Amish easter egg yesterday. Those were just customizations. Today, I did the same thing, but with more productive pages.</p>
	<p>I also did some major updates to the documentation, such as preparing the developer log up until August 4th 2019, updating several pages, and more.</p>
	<p>The site is slowly coming along, hopefully this new work system goes somewhere. I find it fun and easy to mass produce pages like this, and it seems to be good for the site.</p>

	<p>Updates slowed down again today, however I put a lot of work into an update to the update log today, over 40 minutes of work was put into it. I enhanced a lot of things with it.</p>
	<p>I also did updates to other parts of the site, and increased documentation a bit. Development is going strong still.</p>

	<p>I was going to continue working on the site more today, but I decided to just halt development for the day. I have put out 2 massive updates to the update log that have significantly increased its functionality. It has taken several hours to do these updates, I am a little burnt out, and my battery is running low, so I am leaving it with this for today.</p>
	<p>Hopefully tomorrow will be back to normal. The update log is an important feature of the site but working on it for so long and adding over 1000 lines of code is tiresome, especially when you do it hours on end with no break.</p>
	<p>I have a feature planned that I tried to do on July 4th, but it got held off 3 times now. I am hoping to finally implement it tomorrow, but I can't make any promises on it.</p>

	<p>I had time for another good update today. The update log also received its 3rd big update in a row, hopefully development on it settles down now. Overall, the 3 updates have added over 114 Kilobytes to the file, and heavily increased functionality.</p>
	<p>I hope to eventually move past documentation, and basic feature updates and work on the big end goal project. Hopefully that can happen soon.</p>

	<p>There are some new standards for documentation pages. It originated with the 4 recent update log updates. I made a 4th big update to it today, really hoping this is the last one for now. The new standard increases snapshot sections from 300 to 500, improves CSS, adds a favicon, and more.</p>
	<p>The new system is spreading, I am going to start doing massive updates to 2 pages for this week: the developer log, and the 2D start page. I was going to make template blogs for this page up to June 30th 2020, but it got tedious, and I stopped at 210 days.</p>
	<p>I have been heavily focusing on main pages, but I am also doing small updates to other pages as well.</p>

	<p>I have been doing major updates to the site for 5 days in a row now. I am massively updating main pages such as the update log, idea board, and developer log. All main pages now have a favicon on them as well.</p>
	<p>The site is getting really advanced, hopefully when these are all up to date, I can learn how to make the site functional in the way I want it, such as automatically generating pages and filepaths, making site settings actually work, and so on.</p>
	<p>For now, I am getting all the primary pages up to compliance for this. The site is documented very well, you can practically easily rebuild it yourself with the instructions given throughout all the logs. That is really good, as there will be people and companies hosting mirrors of the site.</p>
	<p>Just taking this one day at a time, making the site even more advanced.</p>

	<p>Today, I had planned out another big update. However, it wasn't as big as it needs to be to be considered a massive update, so the streak ended with 5 massive site updates in a row.</p>
	<p>I could write these massive updates a lot more efficiently with advanced macros, but I am not very good with Macros in notepad++ I am having trouble making one that just tabs one line each time it is ran</p>
	<p>The way I am writing is inefficient, but it is all I have. Today, I had a much smaller update than yesterday, pages like the update log and favicon viewing/downloading page got improved a lot, but it was still a small update.</p>
	<p>Just because it was small doesn't mean it was bad. Todays update is still pretty decent compared to the minimal updates that went on and on for months at a time. I am sure development will always go strong again.</p>

	<p>I did a smaller update today, as I woke up later, and I wanted to do other things. I am also starting work on a side project that will help me develop the site a little more efficiently, which is a personal media player.</p>
	<p>It is also written in HTML, and will not be a part of the site root, however it might get uploaded to the site.</p>
	<p>I plan to try and kick development back up on July 15th 2019 (in 2 days) starting with updates to the ideaboard again</p>

	<p>The summer is going by way too fast, and I am not getting enough done. On top of that, I can't put out very good updates, as my laptop is acting up even more than normal.

	<p>There are lots of issues right now, and I am hoping I can fix this cycle. I am also at a loss of music. I have put out a slightly bigger update today, but it is still pretty much the same as the recent 3, 4 or 5 updates. I have been adding to the idea board again, but the ideas I am currently adding are small. These aren't all the ones I stocked up, there are some bigger ones on the way.</p>
	<p>At least I got a really old update out of the way. The UTF-16 info page has been held off since I ever made a page with UTF-16 encoding, which was at the very beginning of the 3.0 phase of the site (In February, 5 months ago)</p>

	<p>I did a large update today with several changes. I am starting to update older pages of the site now, and making modern equivalents. Some of these older pages haven't been snapshotted yet, so I make the snapshot before editing.</p>
	<p>For example, today I redid the lobby page of the old legends of the internet page, optimized, and modernized it in many ways. I keep coming up with more statistics and features that I can add. Eventually, I will make settings for pages.</p>
	<p>I have been getting a lot more done lately. I am working on both 1D and 2D pages, but I haven't done much to the 3D pages yet. Hopefully, I don't go back to plain documentation updates for a while</p>
	<p>I am applying some features to improve the importance of the developer log. Today, I added a link to it in the update log, and wrote about its importance. For text evidence of development, the update log is there for changes, and the developer log is there to explain them, and whats going on behind the scenes,/p>
	<p>The update log is also getting a lot better, and even more specific. Development is still going great!</p>

		<p>For example, today I redid the lobby page of the old legends of the internet page, optimized, and modernized it in many ways. I keep coming up with more statistics and features that I can add. Eventually, I will make settings for pages.</p>
		<p>I have been getting a lot more done lately. I am working on both 1D and 2D pages, but I haven't done much to the 3D pages yet. Hopefully, I don't go back to plain documentation updates for a while</p>
		<p>I am applying some features to improve the importance of the developer log. Today, I added a link to it in the update log, and wrote about its importance. For text evidence of development, the update log is there for changes, and the developer log is there to explain them, and whats going on behind the scenes,/p>
		<p>The update log is also getting a lot better, and even more specific. Development is still going great!</p>

	<p>The next big update is under way. I have found the source of my procrastination issues, and fixed it. I have come up with new ideas on how to make the site even better.</p>
	<p>I have decided to start updating the 1D and 3D pages on a regular basis, along with the 2D pages. 1D and 2D mode has been neglected for too long. Other changes are coming, along with more improvements</p>
	<p>My summer break is halfway over, and I finally have the boost I need to get what I wanted done. I am going to try and update the site more frequently now. Hopefully there won't be any documentation only updates for a while</p>
	<p>Tons of new ideas are being put in place, and I have a lot to do to catch up. Today is the start of it.</p>
	<p>Also with site ideas, today I am releasing the 3rd in the new streak, and the last really basic one for a while</p>

	<p>I have done it again, a 3rd day of new development. I have been focusing on many changes, however the key goals are improving 1D and 3D mode, removing dead links, and updating older pages. I am doing really well with this</p>
	<p>I have been working on the 1D part of the site first. I have finally laid the guidelines for the 1D mode, set limits, and repaired the main pages. The next step is to modernize and add to it. 1D mode is designed for old browsers and very slow internet, and it does not contain any visual media</p>
	<p>I am still trying to figure out how I am going to work on 3D mode, as I don't have any 3D elements ready yet. There was a little issue with the developer log dates, but I fixed it. The dates were 1 day off. I have also come up with new ways of making the developer log and update log work together better, I will try and start implementing my new fix tomorrow</p>
	<p>Today, I also finalized the future entry transparent box project with the update log, it is up to date for new entries up until June 30th 2020, over 10 months from now. I might start updating it again in December of 2019.</p>
	<p>The site is going through a lot of changes, but it still isn't to the point where I want it yet. I still seem to be far from that point. Another decent day with development today.</p>

	<p>Today was the 4th day in the wave of new updates. The update log is going to receive even more updates too. I just keep finding new things to improve on. With the developer log, I messed up yesterdays weekly entry, and missed the first 2 days. I got distracted yesterday. I fixed it today.</p>
	<p>Today, I managed to work on all 3 dimensional modes of the site at once. 3D mode received some new updates to it, but it doesn't have 3D graphics yet.</p>
	<p>The developer log is all out of order, and I spent some time trying to fix it. I don't think I am going to go ahead anymore in this page, as it is difficult to keep up. Lots of switching, and changes, but I got it right</p>
	<p>I also went back and fixed every divider. Today wasn't the best day in development, but it was decent. It sounds like a lot got done from what I said, but in reality, not much happened</p>

	<p>There has been a pattern when I work with the developer log. I always get confused when working with it. Even doing something with its data seems hard to me for some reason. There is also the stress that I might have messed up on 1 days number</p>
	<p>Today, I started adding links to the developer log in the update log for July, and it was a difficult process. I had to keep going back to check to see if I was doing it right. Luckily, I got it over with for today, but I am going to have to do it for June, May, April, March, and February next.</p>
	<p>Today, I also did some other small changes, but I didn't get that much done either. I seem to have found another basic documentation style update with not 1 but 14-15 changes a day. I am hoping to change this. I have gotten some notes ready for next week, but I don't have enough content to spread across the whole week</p>
	<p>The update log is close to reaching 10000 lines of code, and most of my main pages are over 5000 lines of code. The site is getting big and well documented, but it doesn't have all the required features yet. There is still a long ways to go.</p>

	<p>Today was a big day in development on both current big site projects, codename Minecraft Python Edition, and SNU 3.0.5. I put work into all 3 modes today, however the SNU update was mainly just a documentation update.</p>
	<p>The update log has become the first written page to reach 10000 lines of code, where it currently sits at 10142 lines. I have been adding in more dividers, and links to the developer log in the update log to improve the 2 pages relationship</p>
	<p>Adding in entries from the developer log to the update log wasn't as difficult for me today luckily, I didn't have any struggle with it. I have been adding in links 1 month per day. Yesterday, I caught up on July 2019 references, and today I did June 2019 references.</p>
	<p>Along with that, the 1D developer guidelines file received its 4th update in a row, with more rules, and new content. The idea board got another idea into it, but it wasn't the biggest one today, the version history page got a slight update, the developer log got a daily entry, and the update log received a massive update.</p>
	<p>Development has been gone today, and I have more plans for this week, so this is just the start.</p>

	<p>Today was another decent day in development. The update log reached its second milestone in a row, with over 500000 bytes in the pages script, and lots of documentation was increased. I added some new sections, and fixed a May 1st 2019 entry on the developer log.</p>
	<p>For adding in developer log entries, I find it best to have the developer log running side by side with the blog page for better efficiency. I have been doing lots of critical updates to the update log, which has almost brought it to its perfect form.</p>
	<p>A website I use (https://www.khanacademy.org) had a design change today that I wasn't happy with. It made the layout a lot worse. I am working on a section that shows different interfaces of various sites, so SNU can handle them, and people can change them back when needed.</p>
	<p>The most content that has been getting added lately is for the Minecraft recreation I am working on in Python. Note, Minecraft Python Edition is just rhe codename, it will have a different name when it reaches the alpha stage, or when I think of a good enough name.</p>
	<p>The idea board got updated, along with many other pages. Today was a pretty good day for development.</p>

	<p>Another big update today, but the majority of the update time went to Minecraft Python Edition again. I have worked really hard on getting the update logs full potential this month. I am almost done catching up on referencing developer log entries within it, but I have noticed some issues today.</p>
	<p>The issues weren't severe, I was able to fix all of them. I am optimizing the transparent content boxes. What I did was remove the second < / details > tag, as it was unneccesary. I also noticed that the April 8th 2019 update had 1 update overlooked. I fixed that, and updated the counters, but the update download page itself is going to need to be updated as well.</p>
	<p>I got a jump start on todays update as well. Last night, I set up the template entry for tomorrow (today) for the update log.</p>
	<p>Other than that, it was just another documentation update. I am hoping to work on other updates soon eventually. Maybe when the update log is up to date, I can start doing them again. The update log has gotten so much work that it is a whole new page at this point.</p>
	<p>I am still finding ways to optimize it too. The whole site is still being optimized, slowly, but efficiently, 1 page at a time.</p>

	<p>I finalized work on update log developer log entries from the 25th of July 2019 to the beginning of 3.0 development. It is now up to date for now, and hopefully now I can get the time to add other features.</p>
	<p>Lots of time went into Minecraft Python Edition today. A little too much, I used over 3 hours of time on things that werent directly SNU. It seems to be increasing every day this week. Hopefully I can stop it tomorrow.</p>
	<p>I have some ideas I am going to implement soon, I was hoping that I would be able to do it this week, but it doesn't seem likely right now.</p>
	<p>Also, the idea streak is halfway done, and only 1 new idea has come up since the latest one that got added today. I am also hoping of eventually integrating a web version of my project, codenamed Minecraft Python Edition into SNU</p>

	<p>I am having some hardware issues today. Unfortunately, the overnight update didn't cover it all the way today. I have to leave development today with a basic small documentation update, as I have some battery and backup issues.</p>
	<p>Updates have actually been a little dead for a while, as just the usual pages have been getting updated, no other pages. I don't think I will consider these dead updates anymore though, as something is still being done.</p>
	<p>My phones battery is failing today, and I have to back it up so I can get a new phone, and my battery on my laptop seems weaker today. I am working on sorting these issues out.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, I had to make another basic documentation filler update today, as someone distracted me during my last chance of being able to focus. I am really furious about this. This site is going nowhere like this, and incidents like these strenghen this trend.</p>
	<p>Just a filler update today.</p>

	<p>I had many issues again today that prevented me from making a full update. I had some issues with loud noises, medication, and focus. I worked on other work this morning, and didn't do website development until late at night.</p>
	<p>Today I did a documentation update, and in the end, I managed to properly update Minecraft Python Edition, orginally thinking I wouldn't be able to. Today I did another documentation update, with some improved features, such as a server info page, inspired by the Internet Archives page about their current 50 petabyte (50,000,000,000,000,000 byte) server, which is barely anything compared to my current 9 terabyte server.</p>
	<p>I wrote a redirection page that is titled OUTOFMEM which obviously stands for OUT OF MEMORY. The page will be a redirect for the rest of SNU 3x Alpha builds for all upload features. There is also some documentation for my server, but no donation feature set up yet.</p>
	<p>Other than that, brief required documentation updates. I managed to save it in the end, at the last hour. Todays update was a success!</p>

	<p>I have finally decided on a new possible development time system. As by the time I get to website development, I am lower on laptop battery, I normally plug it in, and come back later. I have decided to prevent rushed updates that unless a change to my medication is done, I will be updating later in the night.</p>
	<p>Since doing this will give me 100% battery, instead of the usual 80% (or with medication: 46%-55%) I will be able to get a lot more done.</p>
	<p>Today, I worked on implementing my plans to remove as many red links as possible, and also offering improvements to site settings, and the new documentation from last night.</p>
	<p>I also did some updating beforehand, so that I could do more in the late night update, or still produce a finished update if I ran low on time.</p>

	<p>A new medication system just isn't working for me. I just can't develop this site at nighttime with so little time, and also with my bad laptop battery. I am going to try and work to fix this tomorrow, or possibly try harder.</p>
	<p>Today, I put out a rushed documentation update, with just the bare essential changes to the site. I will try to do more tomorrow.</p>

	<p>Today was a better day for site updates. I managed to have 2 working sessions, afternoon and nighttime. The nighttime session is where I worked on yourspace. Why did I choose to do it at night? Well, I had to do research on how Myspace page creation works again, so that I could get it just right.</p>
	<p>I tried to get as much done with my time and battery life. I had a better focus today. I also had a slightly better time management system.</p>
	<p>Today, I began to work on the NSFW (Not Safe For Work) parts of SNU. I have recently done research on peoples opinion on these things, and I have adjusted the development to better suit everyone.</p>
	<p>I have also learned about a possible attempt to ban autoplay tags and infinite scrolling. I am not sure if I ever plan on adopting infinite scrolling, so I am fine on that, however the autoplay thing is just cruel.</p>
	<p>There are a lot of sites that use the autoplay tag. But unfortunately, some sites abuse it. If for some reason they banned the entire tag just off the bad actions on some, then that would be terrible.</p>
	<p>I only have 1 page on my site that uses the autoplay tag for a big purpose, which is the classic Legends of the Internet page. It doesn't use it maliciously. All it does is, when you open the page, it will start playing a 12 second intro video, no sound, it just tells you about the page.</p>
	<p>The looping might get removed, and the autoplay might as well. I am not sure yet if I should go through with this.</p>
	<p>I am also accepting the fact that Minecraft Py Edition updates don't count as making the website update "significant" as I can't work on both projects at once every day.</p>

	<H2>SNU developer log day 176</H2>
	<p>I didn't have as much time to develop today due to other projects taking too much time and battery. Luckily, progress was made in a nighttime build that made this a decent update today.</p>
	<p>I finalized work on update log developer log entries from the 25th of July 2019 to the beginning of 3.0 development. It is now up to date for now, and hopefully now I can get the time to add other features.</p>
	<p>Lots of time went into Minecraft Python Edition today. A little too much, I used over 3 hours of time on things that werent directly SNU. It seems to be increasing every day this week. Hopefully I can stop it tomorrow.</p>
	<p>I have some ideas I am going to implement soon, I was hoping that I would be able to do it this week, but it doesn't seem likely right now.</p>
	<p>Also, the idea streak is halfway done, and only 1 new idea has come up since the latest one that got added today. I am also hoping of eventually integrating a web version of my project, codenamed Minecraft Python Edition into SNU</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on July 25th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU developer log day 177</H2>
	<p>I am having some hardware issues today. Unfortunately, the overnight update didn't cover it all the way today. I have to leave development today with a basic small documentation update, as I have some battery and backup issues.</p>
	<p>Updates have actually been a little dead for a while, as just the usual pages have been getting updated, no other pages. I don't think I will consider these dead updates anymore though, as something is still being done.</p>
	<p>My phones battery is failing today, and I have to back it up so I can get a new phone, and my battery on my laptop seems weaker today. I am working on sorting these issues out.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on July 26th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU developer log day 178</H2>
	<p>Unfortunately, I had to make another basic documentation filler update today, as someone distracted me during my last chance of being able to focus. I am really furious about this. This site is going nowhere like this, and incidents like these strenghen this trend.</p>
	<p>Just a filler update today.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on July 27th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU developer log day 179</H2>
	<p>I had many issues again today that prevented me from making a full update. I had some issues with loud noises, medication, and focus. I worked on other work this morning, and didn't do website development until late at night.</p>
	<p>Today I did a documentation update, and in the end, I managed to properly update Minecraft Python Edition, orginally thinking I wouldn't be able to. Today I did another documentation update, with some improved features, such as a server info page, inspired by the Internet Archives page about their current 50 petabyte (50,000,000,000,000,000 byte) server, which is barely anything compared to my current 9 terabyte server.</p>
	<p>I wrote a redirection page that is titled OUTOFMEM which obviously stands for OUT OF MEMORY. The page will be a redirect for the rest of SNU 3x Alpha builds for all upload features. There is also some documentation for my server, but no donation feature set up yet.</p>
	<p>Other than that, brief required documentation updates. I managed to save it in the end, at the last hour. Todays update was a success!</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on July 28th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU developer log day 180</H2>
	<p>I have finally decided on a new possible development time system. As by the time I get to website development, I am lower on laptop battery, I normally plug it in, and come back later. I have decided to prevent rushed updates that unless a change to my medication is done, I will be updating later in the night.</p>
	<p>Since doing this will give me 100% battery, instead of the usual 80% (or with medication: 46%-55%) I will be able to get a lot more done.</p>
	<p>Today, I worked on implementing my plans to remove as many red links as possible, and also offering improvements to site settings, and the new documentation from last night.</p>
	<p>I also did some updating beforehand, so that I could do more in the late night update, or still produce a finished update if I ran low on time.</p>
	<p>Parts of the update were cut out to save time unfortunately, as I had to quit before 9:20 pm (not that late at night)</p>
	<p>On a side note, this has really been bugging me with notepad++ and I haven't bothered to change it yet, but the templateaccountblogs.html file seems to always switch encoding back to ANSI when I open the application, and I have to manually set it back to UTF-8 each time.</p>

	<p>Today was another good day for updates. I have made time for better site updates again. Today, I also had to split it into 2 updates, as I couldn't do everything in the first go.</p>
	<p>I wrapped up the documentation for July 2019 today, began to test CSS a bit, and began to work on 1D, and 3D mode again, along with 2D mode. Each mode has its own benefits.</p>
	<p>1D mode wasn't worked on today, I might try to work on it tomorrow.</p>

	<p>Today was a shorter day in development. I had to go check for dead links, gathering a list for tomorrow of what to fix. Small updates were made due to how late in the day the update was resumed. I worked a little bit last night, and worked today as well.</p>
	<p>I am considering making a 2D port of the SNU games section, as 3D is the memory consuming side due to the graphics. Right now it is stored there, as 3D mode is underdeveloped, and also since MCPYE is there. Today, I did a little bit of work on MCPYE (Minecraft Python Edition) as well.</p>
	<p>I was unable to make a proper nighttime build, as some personal issues came up. I will try again tomorrow afternoon/night. The dead/red link hunt also got cancelled, I will try that again tomorrow as well.</p>

	<p>Today, I made a pretty significant update to the website. I brought in a lot of new updates, and features. Documentation got increased a lot, and some new plans were made.</p>
	<p>I finally added in the religion discussion center of the site, an old idea that was finally implemented. For now, only the front page exists. A lot of other pages were updated as well, along with an important legacy patch for the old Legends of the Internet page.</p>
	<p>I updated documentation on it, and fixed a critical spelling mistake, one of the worst spelling mistakes in the sites history (besides the SNU 3.0.6/3.0.5 issue) where when discussing the 301 view glitch, I put in 201 instead of 301. I also modernized the page a bit, and snapshotted the old content.</p>
	<p>Even Minecraft Python Edition was updated. I held off the finalization of the update to the nighttime build time in case I wanted to do more. Nothing was added, but today was still a great day for development. So far, today was the best day of development in August 2019, and it was all done within 2 hours</p>

	<p>So I forgot to update the developer log and update log on time last night. It wasn't a big deal, it was archived first thing.</p>
	<p>The new plan for productivity is the same as the original. Just limit distractions. Doing this caused me to make another decently sized update.</p>
	<p>I continued to enhance the old legends of the internet pages, fixing the vanilla YouTube legends page, archiving its original state as well (as the page was made before snapshots started getting widely developed on SNU)</p>
	<p>I am considering moving it to 1D mode. I also went back and did a really small fix on the YouTube legends page (the non-vanilla version) just a missing tag was fixed.</p>
	<p>I got distracted working on a language translaton file. Currently, it translates to and from English to Arabic, Traditional Chinese, and Russian. All 3 of these languages are entirely different. They are also common languages that are going to be used for a translator service, and to also accomodate all users.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, I had to use Google translate for it, as it was the fastest way, and I don't want to try other sites at the moment, so the file is going to need lots of correction in the future.</p>
	<p>Todays update was a success again. However, it wasn't as big as yesterdays, this can be debated. I got a little done, and wrapped it up before a nighttime build had to be made, except the language file was updated through the rest of the day. The first 2 snapshots were made during the afternoon build process.</p>

	<p>Some basic changes were made to the interface of the site, however, the translation service got a massive amount of updates and update time today.</p>
	<p>Other than that, it was just a plain July 2019-style documentation update. And I am OK with it today. I need to start working more on the internals of the site, and not just the interface.</p>

	<p>I put most of my development time into the translator again today. I still added 1 feature that wasn't just considered a documentation update feature.</p>
	<p>A recent idea from the idea board is now being implemented, which is the ability to replace swear words with sound effects through account settings. This is a smaller feature, but I think it will be useful in the long run.</p>
	<p>The main internal update today was to the translator, however I did some things like start getting some information on NewGrounds, such as CSS, and images of how the site is designed.</p>

	<p>I made a small but important update today. It was a mix of documentation and some new features. One of the most important is a development tool that has all the scripts needed to start a new page. I have been having issues creating new pages, as it felt tedious. Now I have an easier resource to use. I can hopefully start up more features with this.</p>
	<p>I also created a GemMine search mode that goes and finds content that is deep into the site.</p>
	<p>The profanity filter also got another upgrade, but I still haven't made it functional yet. Everything is still a draft.</p>
	<p>Other than that, it was just a documentation update. The idea board didn't get updated today, and the translator didn't get updated either, due to what happened yesterday.</p>

	<p>I wanted to do better with todays update. I was unable to due to distractions, and other issues.</p>
	<p>Today, a fingernail got cut on my right hand, and it made it more painful to type. Unfortunately, I had to suffer with it, it should grow back with time.</p>
	<p>I did some research today, I was simply trying to reference the video tag. I normally go to W3schools to do this, but today, I decided to use Wikipedia. I learned the poster tag, which I really wish I would have known of before. I can now experiment with thumbnails</p>
	<p>Today, I did put out an improved update, with some script experiments, new features, and upgraded filters. I was also going to start working on the new SNU Internet Museum section (successor to the classic Legends of the Internet section of the site) but I didn't have enough time left.</p>
	<p>Overall, today was a pretty good day for development.</p>

	<p>Today was a difficult day for me. There were lots of conflicting events that made my day harder but I was still able to get work done in the end. I got dedicated near the end, and created the start of a series of improvements over the upgrade to the LTOI (Legends Of The Internet) site series, which is now the SNU internet musuem. I haven't worked on the successor in far too long. Today, I finally started working on it.</p>
	<p>I have been neglecting the debug info at the bottom and top of pages lately. I just haven't had the time for it. I worked in my second session from around 8:30 pm to 10:00 pm. A lot of improvements were made. I wanted to do more today, but I couldn't. I will continue work on the new features tomorrow.</p>

	<p>I managed to fully implement the original YouTube legends content into the new Internet Museum across a short amount of time in 2 days (less than 4 hours) improvements were made to the contents. Also, the content that didn't make the cut is still there. I went ahead, and added in the original removed content into comments. You can uncomment it, and the content will be back.</p>
	<p>I am doing a lot better wiht my work today, I got a lot more done. My focus is better, and my motivation is strong. I am improving the site again.</p>

	<p>I had a rough development schedule today, but I still got a lot done in the end. I realized late in the day that every update I miss to a primary page is like missing a coin in New Super Mario Bros DS when you are farming lives. So I am going to try and update as many pages as possile every day.</p>
	<p>With that, today I had the time to update Minecraft Python Edition again. It is still bundled with SNU as it is included in the directory. I will use it as a demo game for the SNU game viewer.</p>
	<p>I have been getting above average updates lately, and I have enjoyed making them. I worked later into the night today, and had both an afternoon and nighttime session. I have started to experiment with more advanced JavaScript today, which will be very important for site expansion. View counter tests have been created today. I currently can't get them to store and not reset to 0 after refreshing the page, but I am able to track clicks, but not views. These tests are in their very basic form right now.</p>
	<p>Today was a much better day with development.</p>

	<p>I made a small but important update today. It was a mix of documentation and some new features.

	<p>I was in a lot of pain for most of last night, this morning, and most of the afternoon due to malnutrition. I am better now. I had to cut Minecraft updates out of todays build due to my available time, which won't really have much of an effect, as it isn't SNU. It is a separate project that was "uploaded" to SNU. However, I was able to get some decent progress made. I have started using the 6th language for this site now, SQL. I decided to use it because it serves another purpose. I am planning on using it for search queries only. Its functionality won't be put into place for a while, definitally not in any 3.0.5.x builds (June 14th 2019-December 14th 2019) and possibly not in any 3.0.6 builds (December 14th 2019-June 14th 2020)</p>
	<p>I am starting to write better documentation, as this site is so advanced, I have to keep the concept solid, or else things are just going to keep changing. There is so much to it. I have updated the documentation today as well.</p>
	<p>I also did some updates to the developer log to prepare it up until week 32 ends (on September 12th 2019) I had a pretty decent update day. Hopefully tomorrow goes better. I was starting to get my schedule under control again, then I held off updates until past 9:00 pm tonight. I still have over 10 days to get it under control.</p>

	<p>I put out another good update to the site today. I still had to cut corners, as I am wrapping this update up at 11:00 pm. Minecraft PY Edition content was cut again, and some documentation was cut.</p>
	<p>I made a joke page today about downloading more RAM. During creation, I realized how much potential it has at keeping people away from other malicious sites. So it will give people internet safety tips. The less viruses that are downloaded, the fewer viruses that will be made.</p>
	<p>I am considering starting a series of pages on this topic. They can act both as joke pages, and information pages for those who aren't very good with internet safety.</p>
	<p>Server tools are now being developed as well. Other than that, today was just another documentation day, with improved documentation.</p>

	<p>I had another difficult day today. Everyone is interrupting my processes, and it is really slowing me down. Also, I had a lot of allergy problems today due to dust, and it lasted all day. I managed to pull through, and make a website update.</p>
	<p>I wanted to do more, but I was unable to. Today was a weak update day again. I hope I can pull it together by September 3rd 2019.</p>

	<p>I was able to output a smaller but higher quality update today. I have been having some severe focusing and scheduling issues lately. I have a couple more plans to get myself ready for school, and to boost my productivity cycle. Some of them include dropping relaxing sessions, and also starting my work before 12:00 pm again, as I shouldn't be starting this late.</p>
	<p>Today, I got to work late at night, and took my time to produce a quality and rich update. I am still working on getting the documentation organized and up to date, and I made a big step on that today. I also added in over 400 versions into the array for the server compression tool. Snapshots, and other changes were made as well.</p>
	<p>I have been brainstorming new ideas to keep site development going smoothly through the school year. The site is coming along pretty well, and I hope to get some developers to start helping me this year hopefully. The site is currently private, but I can maybe have some friends discuss it and help me with it. I can't make the entire site by myself.</p>

	<p>I wanted to do some site development today. I also had a really good time with development last night. Unfortunately, this afternoon I have been suffering with a stomach bug and nausea.

		<H2>SNU developer log day 204</H2>
		<p>I was in a lot of pain for most of last night, this morning, and most of the afternoon due to malnutrition. I am better now. I had to cut Minecraft updates out of todays build due to my available time, which won't really have much of an effect, as it isn't SNU. It is a separate project that was "uploaded" to SNU. However, I was able to get some decent progress made. I have started using the 6th language for this site now, SQL. I decided to use it because it serves another purpose. I am planning on using it for search queries only. Its functionality won't be put into place for a while, definitally not in any 3.0.5.x builds (June 14th 2019-December 14th 2019) and possibly not in any 3.0.6 builds (December 14th 2019-June 14th 2020)</p>
		<p>I am starting to write better documentation, as this site is so advanced, I have to keep the concept solid, or else things are just going to keep changing. There is so much to it. I have updated the documentation today as well.</p>
		<p>I also did some updates to the developer log to prepare it up until week 32 ends (on September 12th 2019) I had a pretty decent update day. Hopefully tomorrow goes better. I was starting to get my schedule under control again, then I held off updates until past 9:00 pm tonight. I still have over 10 days to get it under control.</p>

		<H2>SNU developer log day 205</H2>
		<p>I put out another good update to the site today. I still had to cut corners, as I am wrapping this update up at 11:00 pm. Minecraft PY Edition content was cut again, and some documentation was cut.</p>
		<p>I made a joke page today about downloading more RAM. During creation, I realized how much potential it has at keeping people away from other malicious sites. So it will give people internet safety tips. The less viruses that are downloaded, the fewer viruses that will be made.</p>
		<p>I am considering starting a series of pages on this topic. They can act both as joke pages, and information pages for those who aren't very good with internet safety.</p>

		<p>I am incredibly sorry about not updating today. There were several issues, such as a power struggle, and the biggest hatred I have ever had at Google + Microsoft and it would have led to something bad that would affect the world in a very negative way. This isn't me at all, so I am taking a break so I can calm down and rethink. I am not going to let that happen.</p>
		<p>Other issues include some nausea, stress due to noise, lots of distractions, poor scheduling, time issues, lack of ideas, lack of motivation, and lack of music. There are just too many issues going on at the moment.</p>
		<p>I have to take another day off development. It is 10:06 pm at night, and I have only just started. I will try again tomorrow.</p>

		<p>I have taken today off, as I deserve a break. I continued to make a small documentation update to keep the ball rolling on site development. I had a good time in Spokane, and I went to the doctor, and also met up with some old friends. I also went through thousands of memories mentally</p>
		<p>I might start taking holidays weekly when needed, or just even a 1 day weekend. Site development should continue tomorrow. This has been a really great week so far.</p>

		<p>Today, I worked on documentation further, with this, I imported 85 text documents of website notes into the site. I will continue to add them in here. I referenced all of them into the documentation center.</p>
		<p>I also messed around with Fortran77 but didn't amount to much. It is a very old programming language, and it will not be used that much on the site in the programming tools section (and it will 100% not be used to write key parts of the site, only its own IDE will be Fortran compatible)</p>
		<p>I will continue to play with more programming languages tomorrow, and also make a better update.</p>

		<p>I had another productive day again today. I got less done than yesterday, but it was a school day, so it was expected. I did some more HTML research, and lots of other research terms.</p>
		<p>I expect to continue this, as I found more that I can do. I am planning on creating at least 2000 updates on the 3.0.5 development branch, and I am doing pretty well on this goal. I am still trying to make quality updates though.</p>

		<p>I had a difficult day with development today. I woke up late today, and missed an hour of development time. I had some focus issues with loud noises. Despite all this, I put out a small update, but some great documentation for tomorrow. I have lots of new ideas I came up with. I almost reached the current idea goal in today alone.</p>
		<p>I am going to go to bed earlier tonight, and I don't have as much to develop. So I have to produce another small update tonight. I am hoping to do much better tomorrow.</p>

		<p>I am going to Spokane tomorrow. Today, I worked on researching ActionScript, and writing AS3 based scripts to test future compatibility in the programming tools section with outdated methods (flash support ends in 2020, not very long from now)</p>
		<p>I did a lot of updates to Minecraft Python Edition today, I am going to lay down on those for a while. Today wasn't the best day for updates, despite 18 changes, not many of them were significant.</p>

		<p>I have taken today off, as I deserve a break. I continued to make a small documentation update to keep the ball rolling on site development. I had a good time in Spokane, and I went to the doctor, and also met up with some old friends. I also went through thousands of memories mentally</p>
		<p>I might start taking holidays weekly when needed, or just even a 1 day weekend. Site development should continue tomorrow. This has been a really great week so far.</p>

		<p>I recovered from my sickness further today. Unfortunately, I didn't go to school because of this. I did some of my work at home, and had a calm morning and mid afternoon of development. I had a struggle in the evening. I was going to implement another programming IDE update, but I was severely out of focus, and it was late at night, so it was canceled.</p>

		<p>I had a very strong update day today. I hit a tie with the number of daily commits with February 16th 2019, 7 months and 4 days ago. I have improved the HTML5 documentation a lot today, did work on the usual site pages (update log, developer log, idea board, version history) work on the Python IDE system, and a small update to Minecraft Python Edition</p>
		<p>Today was an extremely good day with development. Recently, I have also brought back development on some older projects, such as UCALC, a calculator suite I created last year, and heavily developed. It is one of my most finished products, and I decided to resume development, as it can be its own standing product at this point. I am also starting side B of my company plans, which includes greatly helping the environment, and setting company policy. I haven't opened up to this since my petshop phase from 2011.I will start company preparations soon, as I need to get on with my life plans.</p>
		<p>Today was a very important day, but in the background, it was stressful. I had a lot of issue with noise and irritation caused by hyper-sensitivity today. Other than that, today was really good.</p>

		<p>Out of yesterdays massive update, only 1 snapshot was forgotten. I won't count it against yesterdays commit count. Today, I improved more programming related features and updated the general documentation. Today was another semi-large commit day.</p>
		<p>I have resumed work on an older JavaScript project today, after an almost 6 full month hiatus. I am going to try and make a JavaScript lightbulb script functional. I have added in some goals, I just need to research and figure it out. I am also soon going to start adding dates to snapshot sections.</p>

		<p>I haven't been doing too well with my projects lately. I have had some procrastination issues, but site updates are slightly increasing in quality. Today, I came up with some unique ideas, and did a monthly overhaul to the staff idea board, along with some HTML5 documentation I didn't put in yesterday.</p>
		<p>I am still learning, but eventually, I will need to get a working system in CSS, JS, PHP, Python, and SQL, and not rely so much on HTML. This has been stressing me out for a while. The site is still a draft though, so I should be fine.</p>

		<p>I had a shorter day today with development due to time constraints. In the end, I also decided to close all the open files in Notepad++ it has gotten far past ridiculous again, and I closed over 300 files.</p>
		<p>To reduce stress from the current development, I have to think of updating the site as the site being just a draft right now, and that I am still applying the foundation (which it is, and which I am)</p>
		<p>I updated a few pages today, and added in a new speedrunning section to the site as I came up with recently. I am going to update the speedrunner section more. Today, I was also going to add in a news portion of the site, but in the end, I ran out of time.</p>
		<p>I enter week 35 of site development tomorrow. It has really come a long ways. It has significantly improved over the past 6 months, and I have done it all by myself. I will need community contributers eventually.</p>

		<H2>SNU developer log day 234</H2>
		<p>Out of yesterdays massive update, only 1 snapshot was forgotten. I won't count it against yesterdays commit count. Today, I improved more programming related features and updated the general documentation. Today was another semi-large commit day.</p>
		<p>I have resumed work on an older JavaScript project today, after an almost 6 full month hiatus. I am going to try and make a JavaScript lightbulb script functional. I have added in some goals, I just need to research and figure it out. I am also soon going to start adding dates to snapshot sections.</p>
		<p>Today was another pretty good day for development, a little better than yesterday content-wise.</p>

		<H2>SNU developer log day 235</H2>
		<p>I took a break from updates today to work on other projects. I also wasn't doing too well with time. Today, I only put out the required daily commits, and no new features. I will try to do something on the site tomorrow.</p>
		<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on September 22nd 2019</p>
		<H2>SNU developer log day 236</H2>
		<p>I had a short and rushed development day today, and I couldn't add in everything that I wanted. I ran into multiple issues today that significantly slowed me down, and I had to cancel some features in the end. I hope to add them in by Sunday.</p>
		<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on September 23rd 2019</p>
		<H2>SNU developer log day 237</H2>
		<p>I haven't been doing too well with my projects lately. I have had some procrastination issues, but site updates are slightly increasing in quality. Today, I came up with some unique ideas, and did a monthly overhaul to the staff idea board, along with some HTML5 documentation I didn't put in yesterday.</p>
		<p>I am still learning, but eventually, I will need to get a working system in CSS, JS, PHP, Python, and SQL, and not rely so much on HTML. This has been stressing me out for a while. The site is still a draft though, so I should be fine.</p>
		<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on September 24th 2019</p>
		<H2>SNU developer log day 238</H2>
		<p>I had a shorter day today with development due to time constraints. In the end, I also decided to close all the open files in Notepad++ it has gotten far past ridiculous again, and I closed over 300 files.</p>
		<p>To reduce stress from the current development, I have to think of updating the site as the site being just a draft right now, and that I am still applying the foundation (which it is, and which I am)</p>
		<p>I updated a few pages today, and added in a new speedrunning section to the site as I came up with recently. I am going to update the speedrunner section more. Today, I was also going to add in a news portion of the site, but in the end, I ran out of time.</p>
		<p>I enter week 35 of site development tomorrow. It has really come a long ways. It has significantly improved over the past 6 months, and I have done it all by myself. I will need community contributers eventually.</p>

		<p>Today was a strange day for development. I didn't have time for development this morning, as my journaling (another project) needed some work. I worked a little bit during my lunch break, and during another break period + wrapup tonight.</p>
		<p>I began to add in the basis for one of the biggest planned features, which is a JS AJAX set of pages that map the known universe live, where you can look around the known universe directrly through your web browser. This will serve as an alternate to Googlr Earth and Google Maps, and greatly improve on it, both in privacy, and features.</p>

		<p>I had a good day with site development. I got a lot done. I plan on adding more tomorrow. Today, I added in some command files, including BASH scripts, and a forced Java garbage collector, codenamed Garbage/Dump truck.</p>
		<p>2 new sub-modes have been added to 2D mode today, a malware repository and a slang dictionary page (similar to Urban dictionary, but better filtered, and less sketchy, with better results as well) it is sorted on 8 levels of profanity, but I still refuse to add content related to tier 7.</p>
		<p>I have had some stress lately about pages growing too large in size, especially the update log, which is nearly 800 kilobytes in size for just the HTML. This may seem like nothing, but large pages are harder to load, and when I constantly release multi-megabyte snapshots on a daily basis, memory is going to fill up a lot faster. Another stress that has been debunked is having to rewrite the site for Linux, but it seems mostly the same, and universal.</p>

		<p>I had a difficult night with development tonight, and a decent development day. I added in the 6th mode of the site this week, now finalizing my requirements for that goal. I will start to improve on them soon.</p>
		<p>Today, I continued work on the programming portion of the site. I added in support for F# (F sharp) and improved support for C and Shell/BASH</p>
		<p>I will hopefully have a better day tomorrow.</p>
