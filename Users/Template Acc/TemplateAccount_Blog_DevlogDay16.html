<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 16</H1>
<p>Today was a pretty good day in development. I was able to do a lot. I added a home page for the game Fa√ßade, and I actually made a working update log that is up to date. I got burnt out really bad at the end, hopefully tomorrow is better</p>
<p>There are just so many files, it is getting hard to manage, and folder switching is difficult too due to HTML limitations</p>
<p>I got a temporary burn-out on the project for the first time in 4 days, I just need a small break</p>
