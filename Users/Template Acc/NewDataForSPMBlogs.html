	<summary><H1 id="3_POSITIVIES_FOR_EVERY_NEGATIVE">3 positives for every negative</H1></summary>
	<p>On my short walk to class yesterday, I thought of a new idea: 2 positives for 1 negative is a very broken system. The percentages wouldn’t be equal enough, and it would be difficult to decide the exact percentage.</p>
	<p>3 positives to 1 negative is better, as the positives would be 75% and the negative would be the other 25% it would also work well as 1-4  (1-9) 1-19 1-24 1-49 1-99.</p>
	<p>Conclusion: Be more positive</p>
	<p>TL:DR: More positives makes easier math</p>

	<p>Yes,<wbr> I<wbr> know<wbr> Minecraft<wbr> isn't<wbr> as<wbr> popular<wbr> as<wbr> it<wbr> once<wbr> was<wbr>, but<wbr> it<wbr> was<wbr> a<wbr> huge<wbr> part<wbr> of<wbr> my<wbr> childhood<wbr> up<wbr> until<wbr> the<wbr> day<wbr> that<wbr> I<wbr> lost<wbr> all<wbr> my<wbr> progress.<wbr> I<wbr> don't<wbr> know<wbr> what<wbr> happened,<wbr> my<wbr> account<wbr> was<wbr> unable<wbr> to<wbr> sign<wbr> in<wbr>, and<wbr> the<wbr> launcher<wbr> had<wbr> errors.<wbr> Keep<wbr> in<wbr> mind,<wbr> at<wbr> the<wbr> time<wbr> I<wbr> was<wbr> still<wbr> using<wbr> Minecraft<wbr> 1.8,<wbr> waiting<wbr> for<wbr> 1.9<wbr> to<wbr> come<wbr> out,<wbr> a<wbr> pretty<wbr> long<wbr> time<wbr> ago.</p>
	<p>When it crashed, I was in shock. I didn't think too much of it. Every time I tried to go near it again, I had issues. Lately, as of March 2019, I am really getting into it again, almost 3 full years later. I am determined to not give up now. I have the worlds still in memory (in my brain) and I am considering remaking all of the worlds.</p>
	<p>There are a few requirements first:</p>
	<p>• <b><i>Wait for Windows 8 to go out of support in 2025 (I thought it was already dead years ago until I looked it up today.)</i></b></p>
	<p>• <b><i>Obtain a copy of Minecraft 1.8</i></b></p>
	<p>• <b><i>Get better virtual machine knowledge and support (shared folders, prevent corruption from no usage (my machines randomly got corrupted one day and I don't know why) learn how to export to other machines)</i></b></p>
	<p>I really hope I can do this. It might take me a very long time to do this, as I don't have as much free time anymore. It would be really nice to have everything back again! Thanks to RTGame for the videos that have peaked my interest in trying again.</p>
