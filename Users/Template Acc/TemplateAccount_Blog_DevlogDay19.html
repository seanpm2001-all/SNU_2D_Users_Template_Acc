<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 19</H1>
<p>Not much of an update today. Today is the last day of my 6 day break. I added a few features such as the cookie jar, and upload center</p>
<p>There is now full access to SNU 0 but it doesn't feel like much. Just a bunch of extra HTML work for nothing. Hopefully people enjoy it</p>
<p>I was going to make a tribute to Pie-Pivot-o, a YouTuber who died a couple days ago due to suicide, but I just didn't have the time</p>
<p>I updated the HTML references so that they easier for me and other developers to access. There is now a 2 way system to the resources and it works pretty well</p>
