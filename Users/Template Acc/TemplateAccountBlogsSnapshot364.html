		<p lang="en">Here, you can go through the development of SNU from the beginning of the 3.x builds (soon older builds) and see how the site had changed, and what development was like for the SNU project.</p>
		<p lang="en">Posts here are made and managed by SNU staff, and are verified by the creator of SNU (Sean Myrick) at the moment, all logs are made by him, as he is the only one working on the site right now</p>
		<p lang="en">Topics range from day-to-day updates, experiences, discoveries, and stories about the internal life of SNU development</p>
		<p lang="en">Take a look around! There is plenty to read and learn about here.</p>
		<p lang="en">Changes on May 6th 2019</p>
		<p lang="en">A few articles on the blog page have been embedded into comments due to them being off topic. From now on, this blog is for SNU development and topics related to development ONLY. The removed articles are still available in older snapshots without editing, but they won't be here directly in new builds anymore.</p>
		<p lang="en">At the moment, you can still remove the comment marks, and re-enable them, but they are soon to be removed from future builds. They will be ported to another blog page (Seanpatrickmyrickblogs) once ready.</p>
		<p lang="en">This is to make this blog serve its purpose: documenting SNU's development</p>

		<p lang="en">when the developer log started, it was purely a blog for site development news, and also opinions and updates from the owner. In the late 3.0.4 phase, it was decided that blogs unrelated to site development would be moved to Seans personal blog page, which was added in 3.0.5. In late 3.0.4 builds, the blogs were removed from view, but could still be viewed as commente in the site source code. This was finally removed, and they were ported to the new blog. From now on, seans blog is separate. Here is a link sheet to the moved blogs

		<HR>
		<p lang="en">Don't repeat my mistakes</p>
		<p lang="en">I ruined a lot of internet experiences for myself. Most commonly, it was YouTube. I really should have done A LOT more research before I started uploading online.</p>
		<p lang="en">At the time, it seemed funny, and like a good idea, but looking back on ANY of it, even a month later, it seemed like something that shouldn't even exist.</p>
		<p lang="en">I started my career online by making videos on YouTube. They weren't the best videos, and they were pretty bad. I could have done a lot better, but I didn't know how.</p>
		<p lang="en">When it got to Minecraft videos, it was like a really bad DanTDM knockoff. This was in 2015, I was 14 at the time, and still didn't know about reality all the way.</p>
		<p lang="en">I made a ton of crappy Minecraft videos. Most videos were pointless. I didn't have a good screen recorder, so I was recording my screen with my phone (big no no for professional video development)</p>
		<p lang="en">It was difficult to record videos like this, positioning the camera was hard, and I was pumping out crappy videos on the daily. Some videos were good, mostly non-gaming ones. Some were just bad without context.</p>
		<p lang="en">When I made the move to go mass-media and try other social media sites, it got worse. On twitter, I had a few friends in real life, and I copied off my friend Jeremy's idea of making "good morning" tweets, but I "improved" on that idea.</p>
		<p lang="en">Every morning, a "good morning twitter" tweet, with the date, and a @seanwallawalla #seanwallawalla, followed by a tweet in the afternoon, the same thing, except for instead of "good morning twitter" it would be "Good afternoon twitter"</p>
		<p lang="en">The same pattern followed for the evening tweet, which was sent out between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm normally, unless I got to it late, and a final tweet of the day (a goodnight tweet) where I would announce I stopped using twitter for the night, and also include an ASCII art pattern, and a duplicate of the text to reach the max character limit.</p>
		<p lang="en">These weren't the only tweets I sent. Sometimes, I would give little status updates, and such. This wasn't as toxic as my activity on other sites, but I still look upon it in a bad light.</p>
		<p lang="en">I also created a Tumblr account. I didn't post porn or fanfictions on Tumblr. I was misusing the site. I didn't know what it was capable of. However, I would spam hashtags on my posts, like 40+ hashtags for a post about a screenshot.</p>
		<p lang="en">Most of it was just YouTube status updates. One time, I posted a story about going into the crawlspace of my house, or celebrating Christmas. I didn't post here as much as the other sites. These weren't really the bad things.</p>
		<p lang="en">The things I look down upon is following and liking fanfiction (before I knew what fanfiction was, I was a slow learner on these things at the time) so stuff like "Zootopia fanfiction" was popping in my feed.</p>
		<p lang="en">I had a stupid rule at the time: see it? like it!</p>
		<p lang="en">This didn't apply for everything, some things I knew NOT to like. I still had common sense. I didn't learn about a lot of things like "69" "Anal" etc until I was 16 and a half, and older. That's when my mind went dirty</p>
		<p lang="en">Overall, my social media experience was toxic. I also was into web design. I used the new Google sites before I got to making the JavaScript (failed port of SNU) and HTML hyperbase (Version 3.0.x of SNU) in web development</p>
		<p lang="en">The Google sites site wasn't the best either, it was decent. It was the starting foundation of visualizing what SNU was going to look like. Originally, it wasn't for SNU, it was for my online database as a whole.</p>
		<p lang="en">However, one day, I decided to sneak NSFW content into my site, and I added "sophisticated" means of getting to it. You could just copy the link, the 20 sex ed questions were not a good move.</p>
		<p lang="en">I look upon this very badly, and really want to get past it. My fetish seems like a curse. I can't get rid of it. So much of it was shown online, and nobody really found out about it yet somehow.</p>
		<p lang="en">With what I do, you are going to need all the correct context that you can get.</p>
		<p lang="en">My uploading finally died down after the fall of the statistic video era, when Movie Maker just couldn't take me uploading 400+ images into it every day. A lot of images were turning out corrupted, and I didn't have time to go back and fix them, and I made my first smart decision: to stop making them.</p>
		<p lang="en">Almost 2 years of nonstop daily statistic videos were finally over in August of 2018. I uploaded to YouTube bi-monthly after that, but then stopped completely. At one point, I tried Vimeo, but didn't like it as much, and abandoned my account.</p>
		<p lang="en">One last thing to discuss: YouTube comments</p>
		<p lang="en">When I started commenting on YouTube, I would make a bunch of random comments. I was trying to be like Justin Y before Justin Y even existed. This resulted in me commenting on any video I watched. I didn't think all of them through, and I don't look back on this fondly</p>
		<p lang="en">Just whatver you do,</p>
		<p lang="en"><b>DON'T</b></p>
		<p lang="en"><b>REPEAT</b></p>
		<p lang="en"><b>MY</b></p>
		<p lang="en"><b>MISTAKES</b></p>
		<p lang="en">This has been stressing me out for years, but now today, I am now finally over it. I can sleep easy again.</p>

	<p lang="en">Development on SNU has lasted for 2 months now, and it has changed my life behind the scenes. I have put in hours upon hours of effort into SNU, on a daily basis. I have dropped certain activities and projects, and I have learned a lot from it.</p>
	<p lang="en">One of the first things that had to go was my gaming. I haven't played games on my phone in a long time now, and I used to play everyday for almost a whole year.</p>
	<p lang="en">It has also changed the way I work and gave me a great taste of web design. Thanks to W3schools, I have achieved a very good level of HTML knowledge, and it is a very helpful reference.</p>
	<p lang="en">This site still has a long ways to go, and I enjoy the experience it has given me.</p>

	<p lang="en">While developing SNU, I used special characters. They made the site look better in ways. However, there was a limit between special characters and Emojis. Eventually, I started placing Emojis next to titles of sections, and it made it look more lively.</p>
	<p lang="en">Emojis get lost in translation. I am going to keep the original text there, as it would be difficult to figure out what it was with just Emojis, and it would be unprofessional.</p>
	<p lang="en">I mainly use Emojis on the sidebars of my website, however that could change. Using them has made me like them more. It is better than black, white, and grey characters in the right situations.</p>

	<p lang="en">Most sites don't let you control what ads you see without paying for premium... that is unless you use an adblock. However, SNU is different. SNU lets you control what ads you see. If a specific ad or type of ad bothers you, you can just turn it off via ad settings</p>
	<p lang="en">You can't turn ads off completely though, as ads are a way to support the site. We have decided to punish people who use adblock on SNU. If you have your content monetized, you will lose 1 cent of revenue for every ad that is blocked. Make sure to whitelist our site.</p>

	<p lang="en">SNU is going to get a major update on June 14th 2019. Milestone 6 is going to be released, and I am planning an overhaul on how the framework is designed. All the original media from Version 5 will stay, but it will be organized better.</p>
	<p lang="en">For example, images, video, audio, documents, and programs will be placed in different sections, while the main HTML will reach out to them. This organization is neccesary, as this site is pretty unorganized at the moment.</p>
	<p lang="en">Snapshot builds will be placed in new folders as well, but at the cost of this, links to older snapshots before the update will no longer work.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am saving this for version 6, as it will take a while to implement, and summer break will start by then. This update should make the site faster, and more easily accessible. M3V5 will still remain in the SNU old section, and will be linked to M3V6</p>
	<p lang="en">Stylesheets will also be placed in their own folders, and throughout the 4 months from June 14th 2019 to October 14th 2019, there will be a similar update schedule as version 5.</p>
	<p lang="en">Version 7 will be released on October 14th 2019, but currently that is too far away to talk about now, as there will be tens of thousands of changes to SNU within the next 6 months.</p>

	<p lang="en">Yesterday, I had a few scares with advertisements and popups. I have had a solution for a while, and these recent events reminded me of it.</p>
	<p lang="en">When ads are implemented, there will be a layer of security for ads. If you were to accidentally click on one, it wouldn't immediately take you to the ad. There will be a confirmation layer by SNU that the advertiser has no access to.</p>
	<p lang="en">This confirmation will prevent ricky clicks as it will warn you what you are getting into. There will be a 2 second delay before the buttons show up, so that you have enough time to react. This is also another step in ditching your adblocker.</p>
	<p lang="en">This will also come default in the ad settings</p>

	<p lang="en">Yesterday, I decided to start integrating each part of SNU into its own section at a faster and more efficient rate. I am starting with the blog feature. There will be some changes now:</p>
	<p lang="en">* The blog editor that was located in the templateaccountblogs folder is now obsolete. You will need to use the official editor (don't worry, all the original contents are still there, you won't get support past version 1.01 for the templateaccountblogs links (which has been removed in modern templateaccountblogs versions)</p>
	<p lang="en">* There is now an official homepage for the new SNU blog page. It currently only has 1 post, which gives general information on the feature</p>
	<p lang="en">This should NOT be confused with SNU books, which has a different approach</p>

	<p lang="en">Notepad++ is my favorite IDE. I have been using it for years, and it works really well. However, there are some issues with it that I have experienced frequently.</p>
	<p lang="en">On my second laptop (201?-2019) I used notepad++ freqsuently on my laptop. However, when a document surpassed 360 kilobytes in size, it would be slightly prone to crashing. When it crashes, if you didn't save the file beforehand, or it got stuck saving, unless you kept backup versions, you would lose EVERYTHING. As soon as you reopen notepad++, the file gets overwritten. And it gets worse as the file gets larger. Once it reaches 1 megabyte, crashes can happen very frequently, and you have to backup at almost every update.</p>
	<p lang="en">The laptop was a low spec computer, 4 gigabytes of RAM, 512 Gigabytes HDD, with a 1.6 Gigahertz processor. When I finally got a new laptop, I haven't had the issue, until April 11th 2019. After about 20 minutes of use, I went to save a snapshot of a file. I saved the original file, and when I copy and pasted the snapshot and tried to save it, it immediately crashed, and when I came back, it acted like nothing even happened.</p>
	<p lang="en">This is alarming, because these crashes become frequent, and I have some big projects I am working on. Due to this, I have to back up SNU a lot more frequently.</p>
	<p lang="en">Another very small issue I have is, when I reopen the application, the encoding on all UTF-8 documents reverts to ANSI, and I have to change it back or else I deal with mojibaked text and [SYN] blocks.</p>
	<p lang="en">Other than that, it is the best IDE. It has strong support and many features with several programming languages, takes little memory, and is lightweight (less than 5 megabytes for the whole program)</p>
	<p lang="en">I hope they can even out the bugs I have in the future.</p>

	<summary><H1 lang="en" id="APRIL_13_2019_SECURIY_UPDATE">SNU Security update - Saturday April 13th 2019</H1></summary>
	<p lang="en">So there has been a security issue recently that has had no effect on SNU, but I should share:</p>
	<p lang="en">I am really careful when I use the internet. I haven't got a virus on my primary computer in a really long time. Recently however, a Trojan spread onto my computer and it was immediately quaratined before it could execute, which means it wasn't even a bad one if even Windows Defender can find it</p>
	<p lang="en">I haven't been on any unusual sites lately, so this caught me off guard. The Trojan was successfully destroyed on Thursday April 11th 2019. It hasn't come back since. It had no effect on my computer, no files were removed or altered.</p>
	<HR>
	<p lang="en">Now let's talk about the security of SNU. I have recently took the time to switch to Duck Duck Go on Firefox so now I have a tool to help me check the security of sites, it was an add-on that came with the search engine, and it is pretty good, so I kept it</p>
	<p lang="en">At the moment, SNU has not been made public. I have been keeping it private, and I am the soul lone developer for it. I have put over a hundred hours of work into it in the past 2 and a half months. Since it is stored entirely on my hard drive, it doesn't have an HTTPS connection yet, so this rating for encrypted connection isn't there.</p>
	<p lang="en">I don't plan on using trackers on my site, I plan on keeping it fair for all users. Everyone here has the right to their privacy. Unlike Facebook and Google, I value the users privacy on my site. However, again, this site hasn't been launched yet, it is just a cluster of HTML documents, CSS spreadsheets, and media files scattered over an offline file system.</p>
	<p lang="en">So DDG (Duck Duck Go) can't check for privacy practices. Once the site is running, this grade should rise from a C+ to an A</p>

	<summary><H1 lang="en" id="NO_FULL_CONTROL_OVER_THE_INTERNET">Why SNU shouldn't dominate the internet</H1></summary>
	<p lang="en">Right now on the internet, we are mainly dominated by just a few companies, big examples include Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and some other ones. We plan on going on that list, but we cannot knock out all the competition</p>
	<p lang="en">The problem with relying entirely upon a few services is, those services have to have downtime sometimes. AWS and Google dominate most of the internet. When those go down, even for a minute, it can cause issues worldwide.</p>
	<p lang="en">There should always be an alternate ready. SNU was originally planned to be an alternate to YouTube, but it turned into an alternate to everything. However, we don't recommend importing your accounts into SNU, and not visit their site anymore.</p>
	<p lang="en">SNU is going to go down at times too, whether we want it to or not. Always make sure you have a backup. For this reason, the way SNU will be supporting outside businesses is by linking traffic from SNU to their site. So if you make $0.06 off of SNU, $0.02 of it would go to you, $0.02 of it would be split with the site it is sharing to, and $0.02 of it would be sent to SNU. See? Balanced.</p>
	<p lang="en">Other than just internet services, you should be even more prepared. Try buying a computer with a hard drive (not a ChromeBook) where you can download content and save it for offline use. SNU is going to be an alternate for every site, but it should NEVER replace every site. This is why you can download any piece of content off SNU (except for restricted content, like TV shows and movies that are still under copyright protection)</p>
	<p lang="en">This is a common occurance nowadays that shouldn't be happening: when the internet goes down, everything stops. Businesses (like hospitals) don't carry hard copies of patient records, so if the internet goes down for even 5 minutes, doctors won't know what to do with the patients, as all their info is stored on a server. Always make sure to keep a hard copy when possible!</p>
	<p lang="en">TL;DR: use SNU but also make sure to use other sites, as SNU won't be up 24/7/365, and save a copy of your work offline for later use</p>

	<p lang="en">I have found a way to make advertisements even more fair on SNU. This is on the creators end: every 4 cents you make off of ad revenue, the money is split in 4 ways:</p>
	<p lang="en">* 1 cent out of the 4 cents goes to the advertiser</p>
	<p lang="en">* 1 cent out of the 4 cents goes to the hosted website</p>
	<p lang="en">* 1 cent goes to you</p>
	<p lang="en">* 1 cent goes to SNU</p>
	<p lang="en">This way, we can benefit you, the advertiser, ourselves, and also another website</p>

	<p lang="en">When I modify SNU, I tend to reuse my assets very frequently. You may notice that the title of the page is incorrect, comments don't seem to fit what the page is, or sections may be completely irrelevant. This is because sometimes I forget about them.<p lang="en">
	<p lang="en">But now, it is getting ridiculous. So I am trying to combat my usage of these. However, there are some things that I used that use tags completely irrelevant to ANYTHING being worked on.</p>

	<p lang="en">SNU is planned on being a huge thing. Right now it is small, but due to poor resources at the moment, a limit is coming up.</p>
	<p lang="en">Notepad++ hasn't crashed in a while, but when it does, there has to be a backup in place. This is why snapshots are made. When a document gets really big, it gets slower on the computer. At 2 Megabytes, with 8 gigabytes of RAM, lag is noticable, but isn't that severe. The biggest document I have written is 2.20 Megabytes at the moment (of just text) and it is surprisingly stable. My last computer wouldn't be able to handle it this far</p>
	<p lang="en">SNU isn't really that big yet with its HTML files (not including bookmark exports, those average around 15+ megabytes each right now) However, they are starting to get pretty big. The common documents I use, like blogs, are already up and over 180 kilobytes in size, and there is almost no lag. However, it is on its way to that point, it is bigger than most of its external assets (pictures) but it isn't much of a threat yet.</p>
	<p lang="en">I tend to look really far into the future, I am just writing this as a "you have been warned" reminder.</p>

	<p lang="en">All social media sites have some way of having users accumulate internet points. They go by likes, karma, reputation, upvotes, loves, favorites, and more. This is a good feature, as it tells you how good the post is, but it has its flaws.</p>
	<p lang="en">These days, people use internet points to boast their appearance in public, even going to the lengths of stealing and reuploading someones work with no credit. For example, the user GallowBoob on reddit takes over subreddits, and makes a post that is completely irrelevant to what the subreddit is, and still gets an average of 60,000 upvotes. This is a pretty bad thing.</p>
	<p lang="en">GallowBoob is an example of when it is taken too far. GallowBoob works his way into moderator status, and censors everyone who criticizes him. At the moment, he has over 22 million karma. At least 15 million of that isn't deserved. </p>
	<p lang="en">They can also be a way to unfairly win arguments. Like if someone creates multiple accounts, and starts an argument. Someone has the right answer, and you start using alt accounts to dislike or downvote them. This is not true in all situations, but when it happens, it shouldn't even happen.</p>

	<p lang="en">I regret not recording development on the site for a long time, but I can't do it. Currently, there are multiple issues preventing this:</p>
	<p lang="en">* I don't have a good screen recorder for my laptop</p>
	<p lang="en">* it would take up a lot of memory to record development so frequently, and I already have enough memory issues at the moment as it is</p>
	<p lang="en">When I do it, I plan on following a specific order. There is also the risk of recording it in 720p and I am not sure that would hold up too well in the future. I am going to create a checklist so that I don't forget anything, and I will have a separate audio track version.</p>
	<p lang="en">Since I listen to music while working, I might have to record the music separately, but there wouldn't be a point in it</p>
	<p lang="en">Hopefully I can start by SNU 3.0.7 or SNU 3.0.8</p>

	<p lang="en">You are currently on the template account page. This page has a unique history and plays an important role in SNUs development.</p>
	<p lang="en">Template account was added as a user profile in the early days of SNU 3 development. It was first used as a test of user profiles in the site. At the time, it didn't have a blog, it consisted of several media tests.</p>
	<p lang="en">As time went on, a blog page was added, and development started on it. It turned into a developer log/personal log for the site creator Sean Myrick. Over a long period of time, it transitioned into being a developer log only. This is soon to be confirmed on SNU 3.0.5/SNU C1.0.5</p>
	<p lang="en">More history may come soon, this story might not yet be ovet</p>

	<p lang="en">Today, I worked on making alternates to the rich formatting versions of specific pages, increasing documentation, and working on blogs. I got a lot done again today as well.

There aren't ANY videos on the page, the document file size is less than 40 kilobytes, it has a solid background, not an excessive amount of tezt, some images, and animations, hyperlinks, and that is pretty much it.</p>

	<p lang="en">SNU development will continue, this Tetris project should give me better experience for how I want to style SNU's graphics.</p>
	<p lang="en">Orher than that, I pretty much took the day off, worked on my Scratch project archive, watched videos, worked on bookmarks, and took time off.</p>
	<p lang="en">There have been some pretty great development days this week and I am going to stick by them, and work on improvements over time peacefully.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today, I created event pages for the world wide webs 30th anniversary (2 days late) and Pi-day, along with other changes. Development is going at normal speed right now</p>
	<p lang="en">I spotted an issue with the website today: the front page of 2D mode has some lag to it. It is just loading off a hard drive right now, not even connected to the internet, and I don't know what is causing the lag. There aren't ANY videos on the page, the document file size is less than 40 kilobytes, it has a solid background, not an excessive amount of tezt, some images, and animations, hyperlinks, and that is pretty much it.</p>
	<p lang="en">I need to fix this issue before it gets worse, but I don't know how.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today, I added a copypasta kitchen, with some testing to get copypastas ready to use by a single click. There is a lot to the copypasta kitchen.</p>
	<p lang="en">Daily update features were added as well. However, today wasn't the best day of development. A few minimal changes here and there were made.</p>

	<p lang="en">SNU development will continue, this Tetris project should give me better experience for how I want to style SNU's graphics.</p>
	<p lang="en">Orher than that, I pretty much took the day off, worked on my Scratch project archive, watched videos, worked on bookmarks, and took time off.</p>
	<p lang="en">There have been some pretty great development days this week and I am going to stick by them, and work on improvements over time peacefully.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today is my 18th birthday! Unfortunately, it is a school day, so I am going to have a shorter party. I got some work done on SNU, it is coming along great now! I am upgrading the sidebar CSS and it makes the sidebar perfect! Once I get the sidebar to a point where I like it enough, and it works correspondingly with the top navigation bar, I will consider adding sidebars to all pages. Each page will have its own unique sidebar.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today wasn't the day for my bookmark system though, however that is just a small hobby. Mini updates went around SNU today, with snapshots for multiple pages, and documentation upgrades. Today was pretty good.</p>
	<p lang="en">So lately I have been thinking about what I should use as a domain name for SNU. www.snu.net would be a difficult name to get, but it would make it extremely easy for people to access the site. www.socialnetworkultimate.net or www.social-network-ultimate.net seem a little long, and I don't know how much I am going to have to spend to get the domain "snu" its just a domain name, but it can make a big difference.</p>
	<p lang="en">This site is still years from being ready for launch, so I have time.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today was a stressful day in development. A LOT of time was put into making a translation page for the start page, where people can contribute more languages to SNU. I really want SNU to be available in more languages, not just English, but this document is taking forever to write. The translator itself is larger than the original page, and I am not even halfway done yet.</p>
	<p lang="en">Other than that, I needed a break, so I worked on the update log and template account blogs. I hope to move to a more exciting project again soon.</p>

	<p lang="en">So the Article 13 from the European Union is up for debate again, however I really doubt it is going to pass. There is already so much hate for it, and it seems like mainly only Germany is supporting it, so I don't see it passing. If it ever does pass, there will be a revolution.

	<p lang="en">Even if it does pass, I will continue to work on SNU, as I hope to finish it some day. Today was a decent day for development.

All I need now is someone who can speak English and another language fluentlu and is willing to take the time to help translate each snapshot</p>
	<p lang="en">For the SNU translations for the 2D start page, I got significant progress today, adding support for up to 104 languages (when translated). It took hours, but it will be worth it when the whole world can enjoy SNU.</p>

I didn't want to have to do this, but I am now applying a full-on ban for ANYONE in the European Union from accessing my site until Article 13 is repealed.

	<p lang="en">Today was an evaluation day. Nothing much happened to SNU. Plus today is the first day of Spring break. I needed a little break. I am starting development on my calculator again. I am evaluating on things like:</p>
	<p lang="en"><i><b> • How I should manage my projects</b></i></p>
	<p lang="en"><i><b> • Worker goals</b></i></p>
	<p lang="en"><i><b> • How I am going to operate the calculator (if I should use custom functions or not)</b></i></p>
	<p lang="en">I also took today as a break. I focused on smaller projects only, all I did for SNU today was update the developer log, and update log.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today wasn't the best day for development, however not many of the main features are being implemented.</p>
	<p lang="en">One thing I like about April fools day, is that I get to see peoples creative and comedic approaches to making a fool out of someone.</p>
	<p lang="en">Also, due to time zones, some people upload their April fools day jokes on April 1st in their time zone, but March 31st in other timezones. For this reason, it is still considered April fools day on March 31st for some time zones, and April 1st for other time zones</p>
	<p lang="en">Unfortunately, I didn't have any April fools day ideas for the site this year, so you can accept the one from yesterday. I have also decided to bring in another feature to SNU, a map of the universe. Like Google Earth, but universal, more interactive, and more advanced.</p>
	<p lang="en">It will be available strictly in 3D mode, and you will be able to see not only Earth, but the moon, Mars, the sun, even past the Milky Way Galaxy. This is a future idea, and it is going to take insane amount of memory in a standard 3 years from today.</p>
	<p lang="en">I hope someday I can work together with NASA, and other space organizations to increase the functionality of the universal map, and get new data for it.</p>

	<p lang="en">Yeah, yesterday's announcement on SNU Universe wasn't a joke. That is going to be a real thing. Sorry about the poor April fools day yesterday, I wasn't really prepared, and I don't have an audience besides myself to get feedback, as SNU is still in a very early beta.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I got a lot done. I sat down and worked for over 2 hours this morning. I added in lots of new features, such as ad settings, where you can manage what ads you see, a big update to the dashboard, finishing up the colored text in the HTML master sheet, and brief documentation.</p>
	<p lang="en">I have other things to do today, hopefully I can come back to developing SNU again later.</p>
	<p lang="en">I managed to get a lot done on it later in the day as well. Despite only getting 6 hours of sleep last night, this has been my most productive day in a week.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today was a dark day outside, lack of sunlight can be depressing. I didn't have much planned for SNU today, so I did minimal updates. I am predicting this, but if we launch SNU universe, Google is going to make Google Mars or a different name/expansion to Google earth.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today, I had to go search for hate symbols to update the anti-racism engine. SNU will allow these symbols ONLY in educational, historical, and parody purposes, but promoting hate speech on SNU could result in permanent account suspension.</p>

	<H2 lang="en">SNU 3.0 Developer log day 57</H2>
	<p lang="en">I am working on this virtual machine feature for SNU still. Originally, it was going to be a separate product, but it works fine with SNU.</p>
	<p lang="en">I also applied a weekly update to the templateaccountblogs page 1 day late.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on March 28th 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU 3.0 Developer log day 58</H2>
	<p lang="en">Today, I learned some new HTML tags, such as >summary< and >details< (I separated the < and > so it wouldn't affect the styling of this page) However, it is going to take a while to implement these tags throughout specific pages on the site.</p>
	<p lang="en">For now, most of the new style is being placed on the blog page for templateaccount, which is my testing account for what an account should be styled like. Today, I also added new support to the virtual machine system, and updated other pages to keep the site up to date.</p>
	<p lang="en">My spring break finally starts tomorrow, and I will be able to get a lot more done.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on March 29th 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU 3.0 Developer log day 59</H2>
	<p lang="en">Today was an evaluation day. Nothing much happened to SNU. Plus today is the first day of Spring break. I needed a little break. I am starting development on my calculator again. I am evaluating on things like:</p>
	<p lang="en"><i><b> • How I should manage my projects</b></i></p>
	<p lang="en"><i><b> • Worker goals</b></i></p>
	<p lang="en"><i><b> • How I am going to operate the calculator (if I should use custom functions or not)</b></i></p>
	<p lang="en">I also took today as a break. I focused on smaller projects only, all I did for SNU today was update the developer log, and update log.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on March 30th 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU 3.0 Developer log day 60</H2>
	<p lang="en">April fools day is tomorrow. We have decided not to do a prank like "Rick rolling" so that is off the table. If you want to get rick rolled, <a href="MARCHFOOLS2019.html">Click here</a></p>
	<p lang="en">Today is the day after yesterday's evaluation day. Results came in positive, and I am able to work on SNU again today. I updated the developer and update logs, and added new features.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on March 31st 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU 3.0 Developer log day 61</H2>
	<p lang="en">Today wasn't the best day for development, however not many of the main features are being implemented.</p>
	<p lang="en">One thing I like about April fools day, is that I get to see peoples creative and comedic approaches to making a fool out of someone.</p>
	<p lang="en">Also, due to time zones, some people upload their April fools day jokes on April 1st in their time zone, but March 31st in other timezones. For this reason, it is still considered April fools day on March 31st for some time zones, and April 1st for other time zones</p>
	<p lang="en">Unfortunately, I didn't have any April fools day ideas for the site this year, so you can accept the one from yesterday. I have also decided to bring in another feature to SNU, a map of the universe. Like Google Earth, but universal, more interactive, and more advanced.</p>
	<p lang="en">It will be available strictly in 3D mode, and you will be able to see not only Earth, but the moon, Mars, the sun, even past the Milky Way Galaxy. This is a future idea, and it is going to take insane amount of memory in a standard 3 years from today.</p>
	<p lang="en">I hope someday I can work together with NASA, and other space organizations to increase the functionality of the universal map, and get new data for it.</p>

	<p lang="en">Almost forgot to write in here today: Today was a makeup day with slight new features. I have replaced every long line of equal-signs with a single <:HR> tag ( minus the : ) today, and it has made the page look better, and also take up less space.</p>
	<p lang="en">There were a few brief updates today, and I made a big controversial move for the site: limiting ad blocking.

	<p lang="en">The system is designed to make it so people who upload content and want money for their content can't be a hypocrite and block ads when viewing other peoples content. When you block too many ads (40000) you lose the ability to monetize your content for 6 months.</p>
	<p lang="en">This new rule was put into place to protect the SNU economy once it starts. Keep in mind, I am the only person making and managing this site at the moment.

	<p lang="en">Last night, a big part of the site started development: I am finally putting in the designs. Starting off in the blog section, you will notice that the background isn't a solid color anymore, and the text is white instead of black.</p>
	<p lang="en">You will also notice some transparent boxes. This is something I have been trying to add to this page for a while, last night I started with the CSS.</p>
	<p lang="en">Currently, I have the hyperlink section working fully functional, and I tried putting in a transparent box over a < details > tag, but the box overrode the < details > and now the text won't show up.</p>
	<p lang="en">This is a new feature, and it is currently being worked on. Once I get the strategy down, it should spread to all other parts of the blog.</p>
	<p lang="en">On a later update that lasted me past 10:00 pm, I realized the text was showing, but it was the same color as the box. So the color was changed, and I spent over 30 minutes applying this to ALL the blogs.</p>
	<p lang="en">I have also attached a stylesheet to this page, it is slowly becoming more advanced.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I have updated the blog page further. I have decided to add a sticky sidebar, comment dividers, and adding another stylesheet. I was thinking about removing the overly extended borders from the blogs, but I couldn't decide, so I put it to a vote.</p>
	<p lang="en">The vote was unanimous, 4/4 wanted to keep the border. So it is here to stay!</p>
	<p lang="en">There are still some improvements I want to make, like a navigation pane on the top, a create blog button with a blog writer, images next to the blogs, dates next to the blogs, and a better dropdown arrow that stands out better.</p>
	<p lang="en">However, I don't know how to do these yet.</p>
	<p lang="en">The new changes from the recent snapshots after I fixed the divider bloat have already covered up the size that was lost, with an additional 4 kilobytes in size.</p>
	<p lang="en">For other parts of the site today, I didn't do as much. I added a blog writer, and updated the firefox account page, but that is pretty much it. However, the site is now shaping into rhe way I want it finally.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today was another day of development. Another small update, as I didn't have as much time. Sorry about this, I am just so busy, I can't work on SNU as much as I could</p>
	<p lang="en">I am running low on small ideas at the moment, so I am digging through older ones at the moment. One of the older ideas I am introducing is user plans.</p>
	<p lang="en">Paying for plans cost money, except for the first 2 (standard, and family) where you can connect up to 20 accounts and manage a network (family plan) or operate as a single user (standard plan)</p>
	<p lang="en">The statistics are a work in progress at the moment, and the economy isn't at the point where we can support this yet, it may take several years</p>

	<p lang="en">Today is finally Friday. So at the moment, not much has been added to SNU, I have had some delays this week, such as bookmarks, hard drive backup (which took 7 hours) updates, side projects, downtime, and stress. Not much was added to SNU, but due to the plan to frequently update and bring big features here at a faster rate, development should pick up again soon.</p>
	<p lang="en">To reduce work on the new update, new directories are now being sorted and made in the SNU Milestone 3 Version 6 format. When that update comes out, all other folders will be like this. It will be a lot more organized, and easier to access</p>

	<p lang="en">Today is the last day of the weekend. My computers processor has been getting hammered by Scratch 3. I am working on archiving all of my older projects, and due to the bloat on Scratch 3, it is using massive amounts of  memory for simple projects, constantly crashing, and it has been a pain for me. It took me over 2 hours to download a little over 20 projects.</p>
	<p lang="en">Due to this, I wasn't able to make much progress on SNU today. I applied a basic update, but nothing special. Development is slow right now because there are so many different projects going at once. I hope to fix these flaws soon</p>

	<p lang="en">This weekend didn't go as well as I thought. I also made a new commitment that is going to be hard to follow. Currently, most video sharing sites have videos between 144p and 4320p quality. I have gone ahead, and made several additional qualities that span from 64p to 300000p (the max dimensions in Adobe PhotoShop 2015) I don't even know if HTML5 even supports media that size yet, it is going to be a while before I am able to implement it.</p>
	<p lang="en">Another issue is how much it would take up on a server. Just a single frame of this would be a terabyte in size. Right now I am struggling with 1 terabyte of memory on my main device. It is going to take time. The other big issue of this commitment is how advanced an algorithm required it will be to do this. I don't know how I am going to regulate it, there is still a lot of work to go.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am also putting in work into a video editor. Right now, I am focusing on the layout. It is going to take some thought on how to make a web video editor.</p>
	<p lang="en">I did some basic updates to the documentation of several pages today. I was thinking about adding in indexes for the developer log to June 14th, but it seemed like it would take too much time at the moment, and I have a lot of other projects to get through, so I stopped at a generous 100 (up to May 10th 2019)</p>
	<p lang="en">Along with all of this, today was a good day for development. I start school up again tomorrow. So I am getting further with my Scratch archive project, and I am close to a closing point, so it might free up an additional 2 hours a day for me. Either that time will be allocated for a break, SNU, or another project</p>

	<p lang="en">That's right, I have decided that it is finally time to work on the porn section of this site. For now, I will only be working on the layout. I am not going to repeat the error of the Google sites edition.</p>

	<p lang="en">This weekend didn't go as well as I thought. I also made a new commitment that is going to be hard to follow. Currently, most video sharing sites have videos between 144p and 4320p quality. I have gone ahead, and made several additional qualities that span from 64p to 300000p (the max dimensions in Adobe PhotoShop 2015) I don't even know if HTML5 even supports media that size yet, it is going to be a while before I am able to implement it.</p>
	<p lang="en">Another issue is how much it would take up on a server. Just a single frame of this would be a terabyte in size. Right now I am struggling with 1 terabyte of memory on my main device. It is going to take time. The other big issue of this commitment is how advanced an algorithm required it will be to do this. I don't know how I am going to regulate it, there is still a lot of work to go.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am also putting in work into a video editor. Right now, I am focusing on the layout. It is going to take some thought on how to make a web video editor.</p>
	<p lang="en">I did some basic updates to the documentation of several pages today. I was thinking about adding in indexes for the developer log to June 14th, but it seemed like it would take too much time at the moment, and I have a lot of other projects to get through, so I stopped at a generous 100 (up to May 10th 2019)</p>
	<p lang="en">Along with all of this, today was a good day for development. I start school up again tomorrow. So I am getting further with my Scratch archive project, and I am close to a closing point, so it might free up an additional 2 hours a day for me. Either that time will be allocated for a break, SNU, or another project</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on April 21st 2019</p>
	<H1 lang="en">SNU developer log day 82</H1>
	<p lang="en">Today, I started school back up. Today I made the decision to start development on the 5th mode of my website, which is a pornographic mode.</p> 
	<p lang="en">That's right, I have decided that it is finally time to work on the porn section of this site. For now, I will only be working on the layout. I am not going to repeat the error of the Google sites edition.</p>
	<p lang="en"> really want to move past that, I am still embarrased by most of the content I put there. It doesn't reflect the modern me, and it is even worse than what my misunderstanding of life was in my Scratch era (2015-2017)</p>
	<p lang="en">There will be strong restrictions against children under the age of consent to enter this part of the site, and there will be moderation rules here as well</p>
	<p lang="en">Along with this, there were a few minor changes to the site.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on April 22nd 2019</p>
	<H1 lang="en">SNU developer log day 83</H1>
	<p lang="en">I did a basic update today. I released a redirect for the new adult section of SNU with very crucial information for parents and organizations. I also did some smaller updates around the site, such as documentation.</p>
	<p lang="en">Just a small update today. Nothing that big. I am saving that for another day.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on April 23rd 2019</p>
	<H1 lang="en">SNU developer log day 84</H1>
	<p lang="en">I am taking a break from development today, as I am stuck. I had an overflow of assignments, and I want to dedicate time to other projects today. So today for SNU, all I did was update the developer and update logs.</p>
	<p lang="en">When I get back, I should have some new ideas for SNU that will make it really great again.</p>

	<p lang="en">I am coming back strong on development after my 1 day break. I have 2 full pages of ideas for this site, along with a bunch of new features that will be coming over time. I will go over the 2 main ones here:</p>
	<p lang="en"><b>The SNU Engine</b></p>
	<p lang="en">I am basing this off of my first thoughts of what I think the MediaWiki Engine does. This engine will be written in Python and will be used to develop features for SNU, port it to and from other sites, and manage the site better. The engine will start development in M3V6</p>
	<p lang="en"><b>The Idea Board</b></p>
	<p lang="en">I am making a forum where people can write down ideas for the website, and report bugs. From here, you can see all the new ideas I came up with today, under ideas.SNU>Staff>Creator>4.25.2019 ideas</p>
	<HR>
	<p lang="en">Along with these, over 30 other new features have been thought of and I will slowly recreate them</p>
	<p lang="en">Development also went well today, due to all the free time I had.</p>
	<p lang="en">This is just the beginning</p>

	<p lang="en">For now, I will continue to apply standard updates, and add new ideas. The idea board is getting pretty big. Today, I didn't really know what to add. So I brought in a few ideas, and updated several pages</p>

	<p lang="en">Today I had another surge of ideas for the website, with 15 new ideas in a single day. I have now contributed over 100 ideas to my own sites idea board. Tomorrow is the 100th day of development, and I have a day off, so I might do something special for it.</p>
	<p lang="en">However, today was just another documentation update day, and a day where I added new ideas (totaling 109 at the moment) I am still really excited for the June 14th 2019 update.</p>
	<p lang="en">I can't believe it has already been 98 days since I started writing this site. I might do some salvage work this weekend to find some of my older HTML prototypes, but they might not get implemented immediately</p>

	<p lang="en">The 3D mode is now being built off of WebGL. Other than that, documentation updates today</p>

	<p lang="en">Nothing special happened for the 100 day of development. I am hoping I can do something special for the 1 year anniversary. It was actually really easy to fix the 3D cube. All I had to do was relocate the resource files. I don't see why I didn't figure that out immediately, maybe I was just too excited.</p>
	<p lang="en">The SNU 3D cube will be a 3D test example. I am working on getting all the logos onto it.</p>
	<p lang="en">On with todays development, I was able to add in several new ideas, along with the normal documentation improvements. I finally finished a huge part of another project today.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today is day 112 of development, only 23 days left until the 3.0.6 update. I have a lot to talk about today, due to some ideas, experimentations, and events.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today was an enhanced documentation day, with some new ideas, and a good chunk of new documentation to explain the present and future of this site and its development.</p>
	<p lang="en">I did a little experiment yesterday with a site favicon. I got a low resolution favicon working, but I haven't gotten the official SNU logo made into a favicon for privacy, security, and copyright reasons.</p>
	<p lang="en">It is too early to leak the brand name this short in development. The good thing is though, now I know how to apply a favicon to a page. It is really easy. I don't know why I hold off small things like this for such long periods of time.</p>
	<p lang="en">The favicon testing is now listed under the HTML test references page. I don't use this section as much as I should, with 3.0.6, I plan to make it more easily accessible and organized, so it can serve as a better reference.</p>
	<p lang="en">So a little update, I decided not to include this in yesterday's blog because it had enough in it, but I found out that my trip to Spokane will also be a trip to Chelan and I will stay multiple notes. Hopefully, I can get some progress done, as 3 days with no progress isn't a good thing.</p>
	<p lang="en">I will try to arrange something.</p>

	<p lang="en">I did a little experiment yesterday with a site favicon. I got a low resolution favicon working, but I haven't gotten the official SNU logo made into a favicon for privacy, security, and copyright reasons.</p>
	<p lang="en">It is too early to leak the brand name this short in development. The good thing is though, now I know how to apply a favicon to a page. It is really easy. I don't know why I hold off small things like this for such long periods of time.</p>
	<p lang="en">The favicon testing is now listed under the HTML test references page. I don't use this section as much as I should, with 3.0.6, I plan to make it more easily accessible and organized, so it can serve as a better reference.</p>
	<p lang="en">So a little update, I decided not to include this in yesterday's blog because it had enough in it, but I found out that my trip to Spokane will also be a trip to Chelan and I will stay multiple notes. Hopefully, I can get some progress done, as 3 days with no progress isn't a good thing.</p>
	<p lang="en">I will try to arrange something.</p>

	<p lang="en">If you are reading this on the 1st of June on a June 1st snapshot, then day 2 of development during the vacation is going good.</p> 
	<p lang="en">I have decided on 1 minor change in the name of SNU 3.0.6, like a side version number. </p>
	<p lang="en">Since this is the first series of the site that is being written without a template like Google sites, so it will also be referred to as C1.0.6 the C can hold the 3 that might not have meant to be.</p> 
	<p lang="en">It doesn't matter which way you call the version number, they both mean the same thing. Anyway, standard development again today, and it will continue this way up until 3.0.6/C1.0.6</p>
	<p lang="en">I have been having a lot of time in the apartment in this vacation, so I was able to get work done today. However, I took a lot of time to do homework and relax today. I still put out a brief documentation update that also prepares the idea board for usage throughout June</p>
	<p lang="en">The idea board now has the most lines of code out of any page I wrote</p>

	<p lang="en">Well, I managed to update the site every day during my vacation. The site is getting a lot better, and a few new innovative ideas were added to the idea list today, such as a full site dictation mode, custom loading signs, and buffer length.</p>
	<p lang="en">I updated the site late in the day today, as I didn't have time in the morning to do so, as I had to pack up and leave and go back to Walla Walla from Chelan. I had a nice vacation, but it was a little short, and I didn't get outside much, just a bunch of work and meetings.</p>
	<p lang="en">Only 12 days until the big 3.0.6/C1.0.6 update takes place. I am really excited to start adding in content again. Today I did a default update to the site, featuring the average Sunday bookmark update, and improved documentation.</p>
	<p lang="en">Starting June 15th 2019, I will try and put in content updates with things other than the usual, something new. I have enough ideas stockpiled, it might last me into the 3.0.7/C1.0.7 update.</p>
	<p lang="en">That is what happened today, I start school back up tomorrow, but development should continue to be normal.</p>

	<p lang="en">This website is really innovative. I am coming up with loads of creative ideas weekly. Today, I added in 2 new ideas, one prominent idea was the AFK mode.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I added brief documentation. The new update will happen in 11 days. End of support for SNU 3.0.5 will happen on June 14th 2019, and support for SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 will start on June 14th 2019.</p>

	<p lang="en">I have almost drained all the ideas from my SNU idea pool at the moment. It took work today to come up with an idea, 7 minutes of thinking, normally ideas come to me and I don't have to try and think about it. I am running low on ideas to add, but there are already so many ideas, that it doesn't really matter that much. I might just run out of things that a browser is capable of at the moment.</p>
	<p lang="en">Luckily, some of these ideas are going to start being applied starting in the middle of June with the SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 update which I have been mentioning excessively in the update log. There just isn't much to talk about anymore. Don't worry, once I start implementing ideas again, it should be up and booming again.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I applied a basic documentation update, with 1 new idea, and 2 pages updated, with a total of 3 snapshots. Pretty average day in the ending period of the SNU 3.0.5 product lifespan.</p>
	<p lang="en">Support is ending on 3.0.5 on June 14th 2019, and extended support may begin in the future if requested enough. It won't matter much, they are just archival points.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am really sorry that I don't just put out entire updates daily instead of as snapshots, but that would take up a ridiculous amount of memory. I am already having enough issues with storage as it is.</p>
	<p lang="en">The site will be thriving again in late June, as I have mentioned many times. Site development is going well.</p>

	<p lang="en">My idea bank is acting unusual. The amount of ideas has been pretty low lately, and it picked up a little bit again today. So far this week, it hasn't been very good. On June 4th, I averaged at 2 ideas per day for this month, and on June 5th, I averaged at 2.2 ideas a day per month.</p> 
	<p lang="en">I came up with some big ideas today, and thanks to some leverage from Google messing up on a feature on their site (abbreviating subscriber counts to prevent live subscriber count videos and livestreams) it gave me 2 new ideas for my site on how I will manage this feature, along with additional ideas, such as a full on 3D printer studio online. I haven't really seen any sites that do this yet, I could be the first to do it.</p>
	<p lang="en">That idea was inspired by working with 3D printers today. It is a pretty difficult goal to go for, but when I get a team together, anything might be possible.</p>
	<p lang="en">Other than new prominent ideas, I did do average documentation updates to the site today. There is only 9 more days until the SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 update, so I will say it again, new content will start to be added in on a regular basis, and there will be more than just documentation updates.</p>
	<p lang="en">I have enough ideas stockpiled that I could keep the renovations going strong for quite some time. Some other ones are too advanced to do by myself, and will require a team of people. I also added some templates to the blog for a few days after the release of SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 and that concludes the first 17 weeks of development.</p>

	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on May 30th 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 121</H2>
	<p lang="en">I ended up not having school yesterday, and I wasn't able to get much done anyway</p>
	<p lang="en">If you are reading this on a snapshot from May 31st 2019, then that means I was able to apply an update today during the start of my vacation. I woke up early to get work done today before the trip.</p>
	<p lang="en">I might add more features later today If I can. I just have 2 more days of this vacation after today, hopefully I am still able to put out content on those days and further the development of this site</p>
	<p lang="en">I did a small documentation update today, with new updates to engines.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on May 31st 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 122</H2>
	<p lang="en">If you are reading this on the 1st of June on a June 1st snapshot, then day 2 of development during the vacation is going good.</p> 
	<p lang="en">I have decided on 1 minor change in the name of SNU 3.0.6, like a side version number. </p>
	<p lang="en">Since this is the first series of the site that is being written without a template like Google sites, so it will also be referred to as C1.0.6 the C can hold the 3 that might not have meant to be.</p> 
	<p lang="en">It doesn't matter which way you call the version number, they both mean the same thing. Anyway, standard development again today, and it will continue this way up until 3.0.6/C1.0.6</p>
	<p lang="en">I have been having a lot of time in the apartment in this vacation, so I was able to get work done today. However, I took a lot of time to do homework and relax today. I still put out a brief documentation update that also prepares the idea board for usage throughout June</p>
	<p lang="en">The idea board now has the most lines of code out of any page I wrote</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on June 1st 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 123</H2>
	<p lang="en">Well, I managed to update the site every day during my vacation. The site is getting a lot better, and a few new innovative ideas were added to the idea list today, such as a full site dictation mode, custom loading signs, and buffer length.</p>
	<p lang="en">I updated the site late in the day today, as I didn't have time in the morning to do so, as I had to pack up and leave and go back to Walla Walla from Chelan. I had a nice vacation, but it was a little short, and I didn't get outside much, just a bunch of work and meetings.</p>
	<p lang="en">Only 12 days until the big 3.0.6/C1.0.6 update takes place. I am really excited to start adding in content again. Today I did a default update to the site, featuring the average Sunday bookmark update, and improved documentation.</p>
	<p lang="en">Starting June 15th 2019, I will try and put in content updates with things other than the usual, something new. I have enough ideas stockpiled, it might last me into the 3.0.7/C1.0.7 update.</p>
	<p lang="en">That is what happened today, I start school back up tomorrow, but development should continue to be normal.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on June 2nd 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 124</H2>
	<p lang="en">This website is really innovative. I am coming up with loads of creative ideas weekly. Today, I added in 2 new ideas, one prominent idea was the AFK mode.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I added brief documentation. The new update will happen in 11 days. End of support for SNU 3.0.5 will happen on June 14th 2019, and support for SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 will start on June 14th 2019.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am still really excited for this update, because then I can start doing new things to the site again, other than just documentation.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on June 3rd 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 125</H2>
	<p lang="en">I have almost drained all the ideas from my SNU idea pool at the moment. It took work today to come up with an idea, 7 minutes of thinking, normally ideas come to me and I don't have to try and think about it. I am running low on ideas to add, but there are already so many ideas, that it doesn't really matter that much. I might just run out of things that a browser is capable of at the moment.</p>
	<p lang="en">Luckily, some of these ideas are going to start being applied starting in the middle of June with the SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 update which I have been mentioning excessively in the update log. There just isn't much to talk about anymore. Don't worry, once I start implementing ideas again, it should be up and booming again.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I applied a basic documentation update, with 1 new idea, and 2 pages updated, with a total of 3 snapshots. Pretty average day in the ending period of the SNU 3.0.5 product lifespan.</p>
	<p lang="en">Support is ending on 3.0.5 on June 14th 2019, and extended support may begin in the future if requested enough. It won't matter much, they are just archival points.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am really sorry that I don't just put out entire updates daily instead of as snapshots, but that would take up a ridiculous amount of memory. I am already having enough issues with storage as it is.</p>
	<p lang="en">The site will be thriving again in late June, as I have mentioned many times. Site development is going well.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on June 4th 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 126</H2>
	<p lang="en">My idea bank is acting unusual. The amount of ideas has been pretty low lately, and it picked up a little bit again today. So far this week, it hasn't been very good. On June 4th, I averaged at 2 ideas per day for this month, and on June 5th, I averaged at 2.2 ideas a day per month.</p> 
	<p lang="en">I came up with some big ideas today, and thanks to some leverage from Google messing up on a feature on their site (abbreviating subscriber counts to prevent live subscriber count videos and livestreams) it gave me 2 new ideas for my site on how I will manage this feature, along with additional ideas, such as a full on 3D printer studio online. I haven't really seen any sites that do this yet, I could be the first to do it.</p>
	<p lang="en">That idea was inspired by working with 3D printers today. It is a pretty difficult goal to go for, but when I get a team together, anything might be possible.</p>
	<p lang="en">Other than new prominent ideas, I did do average documentation updates to the site today. There is only 9 more days until the SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 update, so I will say it again, new content will start to be added in on a regular basis, and there will be more than just documentation updates.</p>
	<p lang="en">I have enough ideas stockpiled that I could keep the renovations going strong for quite some time. Some other ones are too advanced to do by myself, and will require a team of people. I also added some templates to the blog for a few days after the release of SNU 3.0.6/C1.0.6 and that concludes the first 17 weeks of development.</p>

	<p lang="en">The new update is tomorrow yet I have had the worst 36 hours I have ever had with productivity this year. I have had 12 hours to do work today, yet it has taken me 10 just to get this far. I have been having issues focusing today, a lot has been distracting me, and I just haven't been able to focus. I was able to pull through in the end.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am not going to add the week 19 compilation due to time concerns today, but I am going to copy over the SNU 3.0.4 codebase into the SNU 3.0.5 codebase after I finish with my bookmarks right after this. This was also my first day of summer break, and it isn't going too well.</p>
	<p lang="en">This is hopefully the last rushed update to the site today for a while, I am going to try and add new features, if I can be productive again. Development is going to come strong again tomorrow (hopefully)</p>

	<p lang="en">So SNU 3.0.5 is now here, but I am having some huge issues. I didn't realize that the current branch of SNU is over 40 gigabytes in size, and that really stressed me out, as now I am down to my last 260 gigabytes on my laptop. Also, I am going through some severe burnout right now.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am trying to put out a quality update, but I am just unable to. Unfortunately, I might have to take a break from site development. There were no new ideas today, and thus the streak has ended. This site still has so much work, and I am not making the biggest impact yet, and it is really stressing me out</p>
	<p lang="en">So just minimal updates today. I will try again tomorrow.</p>

	<p lang="en">I have been having some serious procrastination issues for the last 3 days. I have finally come over them today. It felt like I lost my ability to work, and now I am up and running again. I have started to do some changes for the SNU 3.0.5 update, today, I did some crucial changes.</p>
	<p lang="en">For example, I have finally created a new user for my personal blogs that aren't related to SNU development. They are now under SeanPatrickMyrick blogs. I have moved out all the unrelated blogs to that page.</p>
	<p lang="en">I have also fixed a bug that has been affecting the blog page since its introduction to transparent dialog boxes: I have fixed the margin and border issues. All the transparent boxes are compact and organized now. I have enabled some of the planned SNU 3.0.5 blogs, and did more changes to the site.</p>
	<p lang="en">I have reorganized folders and their references, so the site would be more organized. Summer development is now getting good.</p>
	<p lang="en">I had to make some big sacrifices, such as dropping Scratch archive work from proprietary to "do as you please" and temporarily end development on the bookmark system to save time and space.</p>

	<p lang="en">So I wasn't prepared for today. My laptop is really screwing up, severe memory (RAM) usage was discovered from a recent update that is significantly slowing down my computer and reducing my battery life. I have been monitoring it today. There have been several technical faults, and I wasn't able to work on my website for a while.</p>
	<p lang="en">So the background not showing up in snapshots bug was already fixed, I just clicked on an early build by accident. I played around with the page to find more bugs in the new layout, and some still exist. The new 2 bugs I noticed were that the blog homepage and blog editor buttons don't work in snapshot mode, which is expected due to it trying to reach a file in a nonexistant path. I will fix this tomorrow, but I am really tired of having to add new buttons so that features work in both the snapshots and normal builds. When I find an easy efficient way for the browser to just do something like:</p>
	<p lang="en">try:</p>
	<p lang="en">normal-version.html</p>
	<p lang="en">else:</p>
	<p lang="en">snapshot-version.html</p>
	<p lang="en">Just an example, that script syntax may not work in any current programming language. Today, I spent the day trying to find alternate equipment and monitoring my RAM, Disk and CPU usage when doing very simple things. Off topic from the site, but there was also a memory leak in Firefox that contributed to this.</p>
	<p lang="en">Unfortunately, no good update roday, just a minimalistic documentation update.</p>

	<H1 lang="en">SNU developer log day 134</H1>
	<p lang="en">The new update is tomorrow yet I have had the worst 36 hours I have ever had with productivity this year. I have had 12 hours to do work today, yet it has taken me 10 just to get this far. I have been having issues focusing today, a lot has been distracting me, and I just haven't been able to focus. I was able to pull through in the end.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am not going to add the week 19 compilation due to time concerns today, but I am going to copy over the SNU 3.0.4 codebase into the SNU 3.0.5 codebase after I finish with my bookmarks right after this. This was also my first day of summer break, and it isn't going too well.</p>
	<p lang="en">This is hopefully the last rushed update to the site today for a while, I am going to try and add new features, if I can be productive again. Development is going to come strong again tomorrow (hopefully)</p>
	<p lang="en">Today is the final day of support for SNU 3.0.4. Extended support may be added in the future.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on June 13th 2019</p>
	<H1 lang="en">SNU developer log day 135</H1>
	<p lang="en">So SNU 3.0.5 is now here, but I am having some huge issues. I didn't realize that the current branch of SNU is over 40 gigabytes in size, and that really stressed me out, as now I am down to my last 260 gigabytes on my laptop. Also, I am going through some severe burnout right now.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am trying to put out a quality update, but I am just unable to. Unfortunately, I might have to take a break from site development. There were no new ideas today, and thus the streak has ended. This site still has so much work, and I am not making the biggest impact yet, and it is really stressing me out</p>
	<p lang="en">So just minimal updates today. I will try again tomorrow.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on June 14th 2019</p>
	<H1 lang="en">SNU developer log day 136</H1>
	<p lang="en">I have been having some serious procrastination issues for the last 3 days. I have finally come over them today. It felt like I lost my ability to work, and now I am up and running again. I have started to do some changes for the SNU 3.0.5 update, today, I did some crucial changes.</p>
	<p lang="en">For example, I have finally created a new user for my personal blogs that aren't related to SNU development. They are now under SeanPatrickMyrick blogs. I have moved out all the unrelated blogs to that page.</p>
	<p lang="en">I have also fixed a bug that has been affecting the blog page since its introduction to transparent dialog boxes: I have fixed the margin and border issues. All the transparent boxes are compact and organized now. I have enabled some of the planned SNU 3.0.5 blogs, and did more changes to the site.</p>
	<p lang="en">I have reorganized folders and their references, so the site would be more organized. Summer development is now getting good.</p>
	<p lang="en">I had to make some big sacrifices, such as dropping Scratch archive work from proprietary to "do as you please" and temporarily end development on the bookmark system to save time and space.</p>

	<p lang="en">Very small update today, as I didn't have much time for the site. I made a change to the site this morning that is significant in its development: I just couldn't find the time today.

	<p lang="en">The update log has been revamped massively lately. It is now the most advanced page on the site, behind the developer log and staff idea board pages. However, there has been some growing neglect for the update log due to this.</p>
	<p lang="en">I don't want to lose the developer log, as it is an important part of the site, and it serves an important role. So I am thinking of ways to balance the update log and developer log.</p>
	<p lang="en">I got to work really late today due to some medication issues, and I didn't have many new ideas for today, so today was the first somewhat normal update in a while. I updated some of the core pages, and that is pretty much it.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am still getting a lot done. I updated the idea board and update log heavily, and I did a little tweak to the bottom of the developer log (current page) to have more transparent boxes. Site development is still going great</p>

		<p lang="en">I can't believe that my summer break has already had 1 month go by. Time just goes by too fast.</p>

		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 163</H2>
		<p lang="en">The update log has been revamped massively lately. It is now the most advanced page on the site, behind the developer log and staff idea board pages. However, there has been some growing neglect for the update log due to this.</p>
		<p lang="en">I don't want to lose the developer log, as it is an important part of the site, and it serves an important role. So I am thinking of ways to balance the update log and developer log.</p>
		<p lang="en">I got to work really late today due to some medication issues, and I didn't have many new ideas for today, so today was the first somewhat normal update in a while. I updated some of the core pages, and that is pretty much it.</p>
		<p lang="en">I am still getting a lot done. I updated the idea board and update log heavily, and I did a little tweak to the bottom of the developer log (current page) to have more transparent boxes. Site development is still going great</p>

	<p lang="en">I have done it again, a 3rd day of new development. I have been focusing on many changes, however the key goals are improving 1D and 3D mode, removing dead links, and updating older pages. I am doing really well with this</p>
	<p lang="en">I have been working on the 1D part of the site first. I have finally laid the guidelines for the 1D mode, set limits, and repaired the main pages. The next step is to modernize and add to it. 1D mode is designed for old browsers and very slow internet, and it does not contain any visual media</p>
	<p lang="en">I am still trying to figure out how I am going to work on 3D mode, as I don't have any 3D elements ready yet. There was a little issue with the developer log dates, but I fixed it. The dates were 1 day off. I have also come up with new ways of making the developer log and update log work together better, I will try and start implementing my new fix tomorrow</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I also finalized the future entry transparent box project with the update log, it is up to date for new entries up until June 30th 2020, over 10 months from now. I might start updating it again in December of 2019.</p>
	<p lang="en">The site is going through a lot of changes, but it still isn't to the point where I want it yet. I still seem to be far from that point. Another decent day with development today.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today was the 4th day in the wave of new updates. The update log is going to receive even more updates too. I just keep finding new things to improve on. With the developer log, I messed up yesterdays weekly entry, and missed the first 2 days. I got distracted yesterday. I fixed it today.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I managed to work on all 3 dimensional modes of the site at once. 3D mode received some new updates to it, but it doesn't have 3D graphics yet.</p>
	<p lang="en">The developer log is all out of order, and I spent some time trying to fix it. I don't think I am going to go ahead anymore in this page, as it is difficult to keep up. Lots of switching, and changes, but I got it right</p>
	<p lang="en">I also went back and fixed every divider. Today wasn't the best day in development, but it was decent. It sounds like a lot got done from what I said, but in reality, not much happened</p>

	<p lang="en">The update log is close to reaching 10000 lines of code, and most of my main pages are over 5000 lines of code. The site is getting big and well documented, but it doesn't have all the required features yet. There is still a long ways to go.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today was a big day in development on both current big site projects, codename Minecraft Python Edition, and SNU 3.0.5. I put work into all 3 modes today, however the SNU update was mainly just a documentation update.</p>
	<p lang="en">The update log has become the first written page to reach 10000 lines of code, where it currently sits at 10142 lines. I have been adding in more dividers, and links to the developer log in the update log to improve the 2 pages relationship</p>
	<p lang="en">Adding in entries from the developer log to the update log wasn't as difficult for me today luckily, I didn't have any struggle with it. I have been adding in links 1 month per day. Yesterday, I caught up on July 2019 references, and today I did June 2019 references.</p>
	<p lang="en">Along with that, the 1D developer guidelines file received its 4th update in a row, with more rules, and new content. The idea board got another idea into it, but it wasn't the biggest one today, the version history page got a slight update, the developer log got a daily entry, and the update log received a massive update.</p>
	<p lang="en">Development has been gone today, and I have more plans for this week, so this is just the start.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today was another decent day in development. The update log reached its second milestone in a row, with over 500000 bytes in the pages script, and lots of documentation was increased. I added some new sections, and fixed a May 1st 2019 entry on the developer log.</p>
	<p lang="en">For adding in developer log entries, I find it best to have the developer log running side by side with the blog page for better efficiency. I have been doing lots of critical updates to the update log, which has almost brought it to its perfect form.</p>
	<p lang="en">A website I use (https://www.khanacademy.org) had a design change today that I wasn't happy with. It made the layout a lot worse. I am working on a section that shows different interfaces of various sites, so SNU can handle them, and people can change them back when needed.</p>
	<p lang="en">The most content that has been getting added lately is for the Minecraft recreation I am working on in Python. Note, Minecraft Python Edition is just rhe codename, it will have a different name when it reaches the alpha stage, or when I think of a good enough name.</p>
	<p lang="en">The idea board got updated, along with many other pages. Today was a pretty good day for development.</p>

	<p lang="en">Another big update today, but the majority of the update time went to Minecraft Python Edition again. I have worked really hard on getting the update logs full potential this month. I am almost done catching up on referencing developer log entries within it, but I have noticed some issues today.</p>
	<p lang="en">The issues weren't severe, I was able to fix all of them. I am optimizing the transparent content boxes. What I did was remove the second < / details > tag, as it was unneccesary. I also noticed that the April 8th 2019 update had 1 update overlooked. I fixed that, and updated the counters, but the update download page itself is going to need to be updated as well.</p>
	<p lang="en">I got a jump start on todays update as well. Last night, I set up the template entry for tomorrow (today) for the update log.</p>
	<p lang="en">Other than that, it was just another documentation update. I am hoping to work on other updates soon eventually. Maybe when the update log is up to date, I can start doing them again. The update log has gotten so much work that it is a whole new page at this point.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am still finding ways to optimize it too. The whole site is still being optimized, slowly, but efficiently, 1 page at a time.</p>

	<p lang="en">The update log is close to reaching 10000 lines of code, and most of my main pages are over 5000 lines of code. The site is getting big and well documented, but it doesn't have all the required features yet. There is still a long ways to go.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on July 21st 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 173</H2>
	<p lang="en">Today was a big day in development on both current big site projects, codename Minecraft Python Edition, and SNU 3.0.5. I put work into all 3 modes today, however the SNU update was mainly just a documentation update.</p>
	<p lang="en">The update log has become the first written page to reach 10000 lines of code, where it currently sits at 10142 lines. I have been adding in more dividers, and links to the developer log in the update log to improve the 2 pages relationship</p>
	<p lang="en">Adding in entries from the developer log to the update log wasn't as difficult for me today luckily, I didn't have any struggle with it. I have been adding in links 1 month per day. Yesterday, I caught up on July 2019 references, and today I did June 2019 references.</p>
	<p lang="en">Along with that, the 1D developer guidelines file received its 4th update in a row, with more rules, and new content. The idea board got another idea into it, but it wasn't the biggest one today, the version history page got a slight update, the developer log got a daily entry, and the update log received a massive update.</p>
	<p lang="en">Development has been gone today, and I have more plans for this week, so this is just the start.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on July 22nd 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 174</H2>
	<p lang="en">Today was another decent day in development. The update log reached its second milestone in a row, with over 500000 bytes in the pages script, and lots of documentation was increased. I added some new sections, and fixed a May 1st 2019 entry on the developer log.</p>
	<p lang="en">For adding in developer log entries, I find it best to have the developer log running side by side with the blog page for better efficiency. I have been doing lots of critical updates to the update log, which has almost brought it to its perfect form.</p>
	<p lang="en">A website I use (https://www.khanacademy.org) had a design change today that I wasn't happy with. It made the layout a lot worse. I am working on a section that shows different interfaces of various sites, so SNU can handle them, and people can change them back when needed.</p>
	<p lang="en">The most content that has been getting added lately is for the Minecraft recreation I am working on in Python. Note, Minecraft Python Edition is just rhe codename, it will have a different name when it reaches the alpha stage, or when I think of a good enough name.</p>
	<p lang="en">The idea board got updated, along with many other pages. Today was a pretty good day for development.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on July 23rd 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 175</H2>
	<p lang="en">Another big update today, but the majority of the update time went to Minecraft Python Edition again. I have worked really hard on getting the update logs full potential this month. I am almost done catching up on referencing developer log entries within it, but I have noticed some issues today.</p>
	<p lang="en">The issues weren't severe, I was able to fix all of them. I am optimizing the transparent content boxes. What I did was remove the second < / details > tag, as it was unneccesary. I also noticed that the April 8th 2019 update had 1 update overlooked. I fixed that, and updated the counters, but the update download page itself is going to need to be updated as well.</p>
	<p lang="en">I got a jump start on todays update as well. Last night, I set up the template entry for tomorrow (today) for the update log.</p>
	<p lang="en">Other than that, it was just another documentation update. I am hoping to work on other updates soon eventually. Maybe when the update log is up to date, I can start doing them again. The update log has gotten so much work that it is a whole new page at this point.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am still finding ways to optimize it too. The whole site is still being optimized, slowly, but efficiently, 1 page at a time.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on July 24th 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 176</H2>
	<p lang="en">I didn't have as much time to develop today due to other projects taking too much time and battery. Luckily, progress was made in a nighttime build that made this a decent update today.</p>
	<p lang="en">I finalized work on update log developer log entries from the 25th of July 2019 to the beginning of 3.0 development. It is now up to date for now, and hopefully now I can get the time to add other features.</p>
	<p lang="en">Lots of time went into Minecraft Python Edition today. A little too much, I used over 3 hours of time on things that werent directly SNU. It seems to be increasing every day this week. Hopefully I can stop it tomorrow.</p>
	<p lang="en">I have some ideas I am going to implement soon, I was hoping that I would be able to do it this week, but it doesn't seem likely right now.</p>
	<p lang="en">Also, the idea streak is halfway done, and only 1 new idea has come up since the latest one that got added today. I am also hoping of eventually integrating a web version of my project, codenamed Minecraft Python Edition into SNU</p>

	<p lang="en">I have finally decided on a new possible development time system. As by the time I get to website development, I am lower on laptop battery, I normally plug it in, and come back later. I have decided to prevent rushed updates that unless a change to my medication is done, I will be updating later in the night.</p>
	<p lang="en">Since doing this will give me 100% battery, instead of the usual 80% (or with medication: 46%-55%) I will be able to get a lot more done.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I worked on implementing my plans to remove as many red links as possible, and also offering improvements to site settings, and the new documentation from last night.</p>
	<p lang="en">I also did some updating beforehand, so that I could do more in the late night update, or still produce a finished update if I ran low on time.</p>
	<p lang="en">Parts of the update were cut out to save time unfortunately, as I had to quit before 9:20 pm (not that late at night)</p>
	<p lang="en">On a side note, this has really been bugging me with notepad++ and I haven't bothered to change it yet, but the templateaccountblogs.html file seems to always switch encoding back to ANSI when I open the application, and I have to manually set it back to UTF-8 each time.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today was a better day for site updates. I managed to have 2 working sessions, afternoon and nighttime. The nighttime session is where I worked on yourspace. Why did I choose to do it at night? Well, I had to do research on how Myspace page creation works again, so that I could get it just right.</p>
	<p lang="en">I tried to get as much done with my time and battery life. I had a better focus today. I also had a slightly better time management system.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I began to work on the NSFW (Not Safe For Work) parts of SNU. I have recently done research on peoples opinion on these things, and I have adjusted the development to better suit everyone.</p>
	<p lang="en">I have also learned about a possible attempt to ban autoplay tags and infinite scrolling. I am not sure if I ever plan on adopting infinite scrolling, so I am fine on that, however the autoplay thing is just cruel.</p>
	<p lang="en">There are a lot of sites that use the autoplay tag. But unfortunately, some sites abuse it. If for some reason they banned the entire tag just off the bad actions on some, then that would be terrible.</p>
	<p lang="en">I only have 1 page on my site that uses the autoplay tag for a big purpose, which is the classic Legends of the Internet page. It doesn't use it maliciously. All it does is, when you open the page, it will start playing a 12 second intro video, no sound, it just tells you about the page.</p>
	<p lang="en">The looping might get removed, and the autoplay might as well. I am not sure yet if I should go through with this.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am also accepting the fact that Minecraft Py Edition updates don't count as making the website update "significant" as I can't work on both projects at once every day.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today was a shorter day in development. I had to go check for dead links, gathering a list for tomorrow of what to fix. Small updates were made due to how late in the day the update was resumed. I worked a little bit last night, and worked today as well.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am considering making a 2D port of the SNU games section, as 3D is the memory consuming side due to the graphics. Right now it is stored there, as 3D mode is underdeveloped, and also since MCPYE is there. Today, I did a little bit of work on MCPYE (Minecraft Python Edition) as well.</p>
	<p lang="en">I was unable to make a proper nighttime build, as some personal issues came up. I will try again tomorrow afternoon/night. The dead/red link hunt also got cancelled, I will try that again tomorrow as well.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today, I made a pretty significant update to the website. I brought in a lot of new updates, and features. Documentation got increased a lot, and some new plans were made.</p>
	<p lang="en">I finally added in the religion discussion center of the site, an old idea that was finally implemented. For now, only the front page exists. A lot of other pages were updated as well, along with an important legacy patch for the old Legends of the Internet page.</p>
	<p lang="en">I updated documentation on it, and fixed a critical spelling mistake, one of the worst spelling mistakes in the sites history (besides the SNU 3.0.6/3.0.5 issue) where when discussing the 301 view glitch, I put in 201 instead of 301. I also modernized the page a bit, and snapshotted the old content.</p>
	<p lang="en">Even Minecraft Python Edition was updated. I held off the finalization of the update to the nighttime build time in case I wanted to do more. Nothing was added, but today was still a great day for development. So far, today was the best day of development in August 2019, and it was all done within 2 hours</p>

	<p lang="en">So I forgot to update the developer log and update log on time last night. It wasn't a big deal, it was archived first thing.</p>
	<p lang="en">The new plan for productivity is the same as the original. Just limit distractions. Doing this caused me to make another decently sized update.</p>
	<p lang="en">I continued to enhance the old legends of the internet pages, fixing the vanilla YouTube legends page, archiving its original state as well (as the page was made before snapshots started getting widely developed on SNU)</p>
	<p lang="en">I am considering moving it to 1D mode. I also went back and did a really small fix on the YouTube legends page (the non-vanilla version) just a missing tag was fixed.</p>
	<p lang="en">I got distracted working on a language translaton file. Currently, it translates to and from English to Arabic, Traditional Chinese, and Russian. All 3 of these languages are entirely different. They are also common languages that are going to be used for a translator service, and to also accomodate all users.</p>
	<p lang="en">Unfortunately, I had to use Google translate for it, as it was the fastest way, and I don't want to try other sites at the moment, so the file is going to need lots of correction in the future.</p>
	<p lang="en">Todays update was a success again. However, it wasn't as big as yesterdays, this can be debated. I got a little done, and wrapped it up before a nighttime build had to be made, except the language file was updated through the rest of the day. The first 2 snapshots were made during the afternoon build process.</p>

	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 183</H2>
	<p lang="en">Today was another good day for updates. I have made time for better site updates again. Today, I also had to split it into 2 updates, as I couldn't do everything in the first go.</p>
	<p lang="en">I wrapped up the documentation for July 2019 today, began to test CSS a bit, and began to work on 1D, and 3D mode again, along with 2D mode. Each mode has its own benefits.</p>
	<p lang="en">1D mode wasn't worked on today, I might try to work on it tomorrow.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on August 1st 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 184</H2>
	<p lang="en">Today was a shorter day in development. I had to go check for dead links, gathering a list for tomorrow of what to fix. Small updates were made due to how late in the day the update was resumed. I worked a little bit last night, and worked today as well.</p>
	<p lang="en">I am considering making a 2D port of the SNU games section, as 3D is the memory consuming side due to the graphics. Right now it is stored there, as 3D mode is underdeveloped, and also since MCPYE is there. Today, I did a little bit of work on MCPYE (Minecraft Python Edition) as well.</p>
	<p lang="en">I was unable to make a proper nighttime build, as some personal issues came up. I will try again tomorrow afternoon/night. The dead/red link hunt also got cancelled, I will try that again tomorrow as well.</p>
	<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on August 2nd 2019</p>
	<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 185</H2>
	<p lang="en">Today, I made a pretty significant update to the website. I brought in a lot of new updates, and features. Documentation got increased a lot, and some new plans were made.</p>
	<p lang="en">I finally added in the religion discussion center of the site, an old idea that was finally implemented. For now, only the front page exists. A lot of other pages were updated as well, along with an important legacy patch for the old Legends of the Internet page.</p>
	<p lang="en">I updated documentation on it, and fixed a critical spelling mistake, one of the worst spelling mistakes in the sites history (besides the SNU 3.0.6/3.0.5 issue) where when discussing the 301 view glitch, I put in 201 instead of 301. I also modernized the page a bit, and snapshotted the old content.</p>
	<p lang="en">Even Minecraft Python Edition was updated. I held off the finalization of the update to the nighttime build time in case I wanted to do more. Nothing was added, but today was still a great day for development. So far, today was the best day of development in August 2019, and it was all done within 2 hours</p>

	<p lang="en">I made a small but important update today. It was a mix of documentation and some new features. One of the most important is a development tool that has all the scripts needed to start a new page. I have been having issues creating new pages, as it felt tedious. Now I have an easier resource to use. I can hopefully start up more features with this.</p>
	<p lang="en">I also created a GemMine search mode that goes and finds content that is deep into the site.</p>
	<p lang="en">The profanity filter also got another upgrade, but I still haven't made it functional yet. Everything is still a draft.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today was a difficult day for me. There were lots of conflicting events that made my day harder but I was still able to get work done in the end. I got dedicated near the end, and created the start of a series of improvements over the upgrade to the LTOI (Legends Of The Internet) site series, which is now the SNU internet musuem. I haven't worked on the successor in far too long. Today, I finally started working on it.</p>
	<p lang="en">I have been neglecting the debug info at the bottom and top of pages lately. I just haven't had the time for it. I worked in my second session from around 8:30 pm to 10:00 pm. A lot of improvements were made. I wanted to do more today, but I couldn't. I will continue work on the new features tomorrow.</p>

I currently can't get them to store and not reset to 0 after refreshing the page, but I am able to track clicks, but not views. These tests are in their very basic form right now.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today was a much better day with development.</p>

	<p lang="en">I have updated the developer logs internal documentation to match that of the update log in an overnight build last night. I have also gotten into the habit of copying blogs into a commented compilation section for upcoming weekly compilation blogs.</p>
	<p lang="en">I had some severe issues with procrastination today, and I was only able to put out a tiny update tonight just to wrap it up. I need to get my schedule together again.</p>

	<p lang="en">Today I put out another lower quality update due to some issues involving scheduling, and hardware. I am going to try my best to not put out site documentation only updates, as that is pointless when there is nothing else. I am going to try and update at least 1 thing other than that daily.</p>
	<p lang="en">Today, I chose to update the algorithm. I made a new algorithm. It will be very advanced, and I can't make the mistakes other companies did. The algorithm will track all changes, and give detailed reports about content.</p>
	<p lang="en">Since I don't even have a system to test it yet, I am making a plain text list of features to detect. Other than that, today was a bad day for development.</p>

	<p lang="en">I was in a lot of pain for most of last night, this morning, and most of the afternoon due to malnutrition. I am better now. I had to cut Minecraft updates out of todays build due to my available time, which won't really have much of an effect, as it isn't SNU. It is a separate project that was "uploaded" to SNU. However, I was able to get some decent progress made. I have started using the 6th language for this site now, SQL. I decided to use it because it serves another purpose. I am planning on using it for search queries only. Its functionality won't be put into place for a while, definitally not in any 3.0.5.x builds (June 14th 2019-December 14th 2019) and possibly not in any 3.0.6 builds (December 14th 2019-June 14th 2020)</p>
	<p lang="en">I am starting to write better documentation, as this site is so advanced, I have to keep the concept solid, or else things are just going to keep changing. There is so much to it. I have updated the documentation today as well.</p>
	<p lang="en">I also did some updates to the developer log to prepare it up until week 32 ends (on September 12th 2019) I had a pretty decent update day. Hopefully tomorrow goes better. I was starting to get my schedule under control again, then I held off updates until past 9:00 pm tonight. I still have over 10 days to get it under control.</p>

		<p lang="en">Some other minor documentation updates were made, along with a brief version list update to the server essentials set. I worked late at night tonight, and got a good update out. 10:20 pm is when I started writing here. This page is now over 500 kilobytes in size.</p>

		<p lang="en">I wanted to do some site development today. I also had a really good time with development last night. Unfortunately, this afternoon I have been suffering with a stomach bug and nausea. I don't take breaks from developing this site very often, and I think I just need 1 break day for once. I should come back to development even stronger tomorrow too hopefully.</p>
		<p lang="en">I had a concept this morning that I will discuss tomorrow. Today, I just need to get the update over with and recover. It isn't a severe issue, just a mild stomach bug. It should be gone by tomorrow. I also need to get back into the school schedule, as school starts in less than 7 days for me.</p>

		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 210</H2>
		<p lang="en">I am extremely sorry, but I have to take the day off again today. I am having nausea issues still, and I also need to adjust my schedules. The nausea is severe, and I am really hoping it isn't a stomach bug.</p>
		<p lang="en">If issues pursue, I might not update for an even longer time if things don't get better. I will try again tomorrow. Hopefully it is just a temporary issue.</p>

		<p lang="en">I am incredibly sorry about not updating today. There were several issues, such as a power struggle, and the biggest hatred I have ever had at Google + Microsoft and it would have led to something bad that would affect the world in a very negative way. This isn't me at all, so I am taking a break so I can calm down and rethink. I am not going to let that happen.</p>
		<p lang="en">Other issues include some nausea, stress due to noise, lots of distractions, poor scheduling, time issues, lack of ideas, lack of motivation, and lack of music. There are just too many issues going on at the moment.</p>
		<p lang="en">I have to take another day off development. It is 10:06 pm at night, and I have only just started. I will try again tomorrow.</p>

		<p lang="en">I am going to go to bed earlier tonight, and I don't have as much to develop. So I have to produce another small update tonight. I am hoping to do much better tomorrow.</p>

		<p lang="en">I recovered from my sickness further today. Unfortunately, I didn't go to school because of this. I did some of my work at home, and had a calm morning and mid afternoon of development. I had a struggle in the evening. I was going to implement another programming IDE update, but I was severely out of focus, and it was late at night, so it was canceled.</p>
		<p lang="en">Tomorrow will hopefully return to normal. I am hoping my productivity rate stays with it (from September 15th 2019)</p>

Recently, I have also brought back development on some older projects, such as UCALC, a calculator suite I created last year, and heavily developed. It is one of my most finished products, and I decided to resume development, as it can be its own standing product at this point. I am also starting side B of my company plans, which includes greatly helping the environment, and setting company policy. I haven't opened up to this since my petshop phase from 2011.I will start company preparations soon, as I need to get on with my life plans.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today was a very important day, but in the background, it was stressful. I had a lot of issue with noise and irritation caused by hyper-sensitivity today. Other than that, today was really good.</p>

		<p lang="en">Today, I did massive improvements to the speedrun engine section, writing several engines in C, Assembly, and Java. All programming languages are similar in their own ways, and it will take me some time to get the syntax down. There is still research to be done as well.</p>
		<p lang="en">I also added in an improved CSS scriptstarter, with some forgotten changes from yesterday, a documentation update, with a little templating for the developer log. Today went decent, I wanted to do more, but my focus died out, and I ran low on time.</p>

		<p lang="en">I improved the site a little bit today, but not as much as I wanted. I added new scriptstarters for CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript functionality. I also implemented some other features, such as SNU news, some new icons, and improvements to the speedrunner page.</p>
		<p lang="en">I got a networking problem fixed today, it was just a loose cable. It wasn't a cause of website disruption, but now the internet is fast again, and doesn't randomly disconnect every minute.</p>

		<p lang="en">I had a lot of time to develop today. I ran into issues after school ended, as my focus just dies after school ends, and it is really annoying. This isn't a problem on the weekends, and if it is, it is a lot more controllable.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I did massive improvements to the speedrun engine section, writing several engines in C, Assembly, and Java. All programming languages are similar in their own ways, and it will take me some time to get the syntax down. There is still research to be done as well.</p>
		<p lang="en">I also added in an improved CSS scriptstarter, with some forgotten changes from yesterday, a documentation update, with a little templating for the developer log. Today went decent, I wanted to do more, but my focus died out, and I ran low on time.</p>
		<p lang="en">It is the weekend, and I have a huge bucketlist, that might spill into next week.</p>

		<p lang="en">I had a good day with site development. I got a lot done. I plan on adding more tomorrow. Today, I added in some command files, including BASH scripts, and a forced Java garbage collector, codenamed Garbage/Dump truck.</p>
		<p lang="en">2 new sub-modes have been added to 2D mode today, a malware repository and a slang dictionary page (similar to Urban dictionary, but better filtered, and less sketchy, with better results as well) it is sorted on 8 levels of profanity, but I still refuse to add content related to tier 7.</p>
		<p lang="en">I have had some stress lately about pages growing too large in size, especially the update log, which is nearly 800 kilobytes in size for just the HTML. This may seem like nothing, but large pages are harder to load, and when I constantly release multi-megabyte snapshots on a daily basis, memory is going to fill up a lot faster. Another stress that has been debunked is having to rewrite the site for Linux, but it seems mostly the same, and universal.</p>

		<p lang="en">I had a smaller update today. Most development went into the MCPYE sideproject. I did some crucial updates to sample BASH scripts, including a massive disclaimer for use of the [<i>sudo rm -rf / -no-preseve-root-</i>] command</p>
		<p lang="en">I added in the 5th mode of the week, but I didn't have much to improve on it with. I will add in the 6th and final mode for the week tomorrow.</p>

		<p lang="en">I had a difficult night with development tonight, and a decent development day. I added in the 6th mode of the site this week, now finalizing my requirements for that goal. I will start to improve on them soon.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I continued work on the programming portion of the site. I added in support for F# (F sharp) and improved support for C and Shell/BASH</p>
		<p lang="en">I will hopefully have a better day tomorrow.</p>

		<p lang="en">I did some updates to the programming section of the site, but I have been distracted with other things today, and I am likely going to need a break soon.</p>
		<p lang="en">I added in the first Favicon for the programming section (For the C programming section) today I added in support for Swift and did updates to the Ada and C pages, along with updates to several files. Other than that, only documentation changes were made</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on October 12th 2019</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 256</H2>
		<p lang="en">Today, I did further improvements to the programming section of the site, adding in a few favicons today, and updating the pages to get them to the new standard for the section. I added in support for the B programming language today.</p>
		<p lang="en">The B programming language is archaic, so you might be wondering why I am adding it in? I want to support all programming languages on the site, even the oldest and most unsupported ones, as B has barely been used for the past 40+ years.</p>
		<p lang="en">I updated the favicon site archive as well, and did general documentation updates. I am getting a good system in place for the site for the future structuring of the site, and the rolling release cycle that comes after the Alpha and Beta phases.</p>

		<p lang="en">Today, I wrapped up updates before noon, as I have a dentists appointment, I added in all my ideas for the day, and I need a break. I don't want last night to constantly repeat itself, where I get really tired, and take hours to get work done.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I updated the PHP and C pages, but didn't have an internet connection to get required images, such as the PHP logo, the elePHPant and more. I also revised and made some tweaks to the 1.0.1.1 standards for the programming section of the site, releasing the 1.0.1.2 update, and making the C and PHP pages compliant with it.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today wasn't a good day for development, I just need a break. I am planning on doing a lot this weekend, as I will have a lot more time, but for now, further updates won't be happening today.</p>

		<p lang="en">I have recently changed a stressful thought of too many ideas coming in at once from a negative thing to a positive thing. I realized that the more ideas I have to implement, the longer I can keep up development.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I focused mainly on documentation updates, and I finished up blockly IDE work for now. I didn't do much today.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on November 7th 2019</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 282</H2>
		<p lang="en">I did a smaller update today, a really short one for the week. I took today as a somewhat day off, and also a day to process the current ideas I have, and what to do next.</p>
		<p lang="en">All SNU-based development was done with documentation, while the rest was programming repository work, mainly for the WacOS repository.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today wsn't the best day for development, it was pretty much jsut a break day.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on November 8th 2019</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 283</H2>
		<p lang="en">I wasn't able to update the site today. I had a major lack of focus, I was a little sick, and I didn't have too much to do with the site today.</p>
		<p lang="en">My weekend hasn't been going very good, and it continues to get worse. I could have updated the site yesterday, but I decided not to, as the only unique feature would be a TCL programming languae IDE</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on November 9th 2019</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 284</H2>
		<p lang="en">My weekend has gotten worse. One of my pets is very close to death (a fish I have had for several years) and it is going to die within a few hours. I struggled to focus for an update tonight, and I was able to.</p>
		<p lang="en">I am still a little sick as well. I have 10 planned updates for tomorrow.</p>
		<p lang="en">I backed up my hard drive today, it took multiple hours, and I didn't have as much time to develop my site today due to this.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on November 10th 2019</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 285</H2>
		<p lang="en">I had a better day with development today. I am starting to get a lot more descriptive with updates now</p>
		<p lang="en">I didn't have a good day out of development, 2 of my pets died today, ones I have had for a very long time.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I added in more repository updates and features, some improved documentation changes, and further snapshots</p>
		<p lang="en">I start school again tomorrow.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on November 11th 2019</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 286</H2>
		<p lang="en">I had a better day with development today. At first I wasn't sure what to add, and I came up with ideas overtime.</p>
		<p lang="en">Todays update was focused on themes, repositories, and documentation. I also improved on the DMail (SNU Email) client today. I have updated it to version 1.02, its development branches will get an update with every major SNU update where DMail gets updated (for example, 3.0.5, the current branch)</p>
		<p lang="en">I got a lot done today. On Friday, I go to Spokane for a doctors appointment and I am unsure if I will have time to develop the site that day.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on November 12th 2019</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 287</H2>
		<p lang="en">I had a shorter development day today, I didn't add as much as I didn't know what to add. I worked on adding in the BotCoach, which has been held off for a long time now, and I did an update to DMAIL that I didn't get time for yesterday.</p>
		<p lang="en">I only produced 12 updates today. I will try to do more tomorrow. I just wasn't very inspired today.</p>

		<p lang="en">I had a small development day today, I was frequently out of focus. At least I had some development time this weekend.</p>
		<p lang="en">With the way the site is currently written, I feel like it is going to be a huge piece of laughing stock for r/programmerhumor for a while. I am still just applying the base, I am not doing the best job at it though.</p>
		<p lang="en">Overtime, the site is becoming more advanced, new improvements are made on a monthly basis, and I have been completely self-taught on all of this.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today I added in 0 dimensional moder, and 4D mode. Both modes are easter eggs, 4D mode will be more useful than 0D mode. 0D mode is a joke, as you can't view 0 dimensional content. 4 dimensional mode is going to be an upgrade on 3D mode for those who love tesseracts.</p>
		<p lang="en">I have stated on the 4D mode page that there likely won't be a 5D mode unless the idea is supported, but the option is definitally not off the table. I just don't have a use in it yet. If anyone really wants it, I am willing to go up to 9D mode max, after that I will likely stop accepting new mode ideas.</p>
		<p lang="en">Why 9D? I like the 2 byte directory names, and it can be 0D to 9D. I still won't go above 4D unless it gets support.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today was a decent day with development, but not entirely the best.</p>

		<p lang="en">I created a slightly bigger update today with a major overhaul to the 2D start page, finalizations for 0D mode, security improvements (Androids.txt), bug fixes, and cloud gaming support.</p>
		<p lang="en">Todays update was an improvement over features from yesterday, and I am currently in the process of getting developer help for site development.</p>
		<p lang="en">I later on added in a lot of new features, and I have a new standard to introduce tomorrow: predefined fonts.</p>
		<p lang="en">I have realized that SNU will look different on different browsers, and I will start setting default fonts, and later on, an option for users to change the fonts. Page defaults will stay in though.</p>

		<p lang="en">I produced another small documentation update today. My laptop was performing horribly yesterday, but it is acting a lot better today.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today I produced a small documentation update, and wrapped up work on the website early today. I am gathering ideas and waiting for the next big update.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on December 12th 2019</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 317</H2>
		<p lang="en">I had a short day with development today. I have some features planned to define the next update, and I only produced a small documentation update today.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today is the last day in development for SNU 3.0.5, I will start development on 3.0.6 tomorrow.</p>
		<p lang="en">Currently, my focuses on 3.0.6 is bringing focus to legacy SNU features, and getting the site recognized by a team of developers. Along with that, usual updates will occur just like in 3.0.5</p>
		<p lang="en">This has been a really good development period for the past 6 months, and I hope to have an even better next 6 months.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on December 13th 2019</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 318</H2>
		<p lang="en">I laid down the foundation for the SNU 3.0.6 update today. This update is going to focus on older features, and development from various people instead of just by myself.</p>
		<p lang="en">I produced a small update today, which is better than nothing. I have more planned for tomorrow.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on December 14th 2019</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 319</H2>
		<p lang="en">I had a small development day today, I was frequently out of focus. At least I had some development time this weekend.</p>
		<p lang="en">With the way the site is currently written, I feel like it is going to be a huge piece of laughing stock for r/programmerhumor for a while. I am still just applying the base, I am not doing the best job at it though.</p>
		<p lang="en">Overtime, the site is becoming more advanced, new improvements are made on a monthly basis, and I have been completely self-taught on all of this.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today I added in 0 dimensional moder, and 4D mode. Both modes are easter eggs, 4D mode will be more useful than 0D mode. 0D mode is a joke, as you can't view 0 dimensional content. 4 dimensional mode is going to be an upgrade on 3D mode for those who love tesseracts.</p>
		<p lang="en">I have stated on the 4D mode page that there likely won't be a 5D mode unless the idea is supported, but the option is definitally not off the table. I just don't have a use in it yet. If anyone really wants it, I am willing to go up to 9D mode max, after that I will likely stop accepting new mode ideas.</p>
		<p lang="en">Why 9D? I like the 2 byte directory names, and it can be 0D to 9D. I still won't go above 4D unless it gets support.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today was a decent day with development, but not entirely the best.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on December 15th 2019</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 320</H2>
		<p lang="en">I created a slightly bigger update today with a major overhaul to the 2D start page, finalizations for 0D mode, security improvements (Androids.txt), bug fixes, and cloud gaming support.</p>
		<p lang="en">Todays update was an improvement over features from yesterday, and I am currently in the process of getting developer help for site development.</p>
		<p lang="en">I later on added in a lot of new features, and I have a new standard to introduce tomorrow: predefined fonts.</p>
		<p lang="en">I have realized that SNU will look different on different browsers, and I will start setting default fonts, and later on, an option for users to change the fonts. Page defaults will stay in though.</p>

		<p lang="en">I produced a smaller update today with a lot of commit changes again. I am going through one section of the HTTP status list per day, tomorrow is going to be the biggest one in the official range (since 4.xx has a lot of status codes)</p>
		<p lang="en">I also did some JavaScript work, documentation changes, and improvements to some features such as the SNU Clock. My work ethic seems to be back and stable, and I have everything balanced. I am REALLY hoping it doesn't fall apart in the next 3 days (example: stopping website development for at least 1 day)</p>
		<p lang="en">I have been getting a lot done lately, as of yesterday I have already reached 100 commits in the 3.0.6 period, in just 4 days. I still have a lot to do, and my research level is still increasing. I will hopefully be able to make major improvements soon.</p>
		<p lang="en">I didn't do much web development research today, but I am getting something ready for tomorrow. I also have lots of plans for features at the moment.</p>

		<p lang="en">I had another good day with development. Today I worked heavily on the HTTP documentation center, with the entire range of 4.x.x protocols, 1 5.x.x protocol, and a massive update to its main page. Along with this, I began experimenting with XHHTML, and I did upgrades to documentation.</p>
		<p lang="en">Development so far is going well, but the commit count compared to update quality is a little low.</p>
		<p lang="en">Lately, I have been using the update log to store notes instead of an external txt file. This has raised the size of the update log, but it provides documentation for myself. I may start removing older entries, as each day produces sometimes over 2 kilobytes, this builds up overtime.</p>
		<p lang="en">The notes have been used as a Todo list of features and improvements to the site. The sections I follow most are 2 separate "todo today" areas, where I still don't get to everything.</p> 
		<p lang="en">I am starting to lose interest in the development of the HTTP list. It is a useful resource, but it isn't a major feature of the site. I am going to try and get it over with, then move on to the next thing.</p>
		<p lang="en">I eventually had to stop, as I was just really tired of updating the site today, and I took a break. There also wasn't too much else to add in.</p>

		<p lang="en">I have learned about an appointment reschedule, on January 3rd 2019. Here is the quoted text I put out for that day:</p>
		<p lang="en"><i>"I have an appointment scheduled for today. I am having my Wisdom teeth removed in a 9:00 am appointment. I have been told all my life by dentists that my mouth was big enough to not have them removed. Unfortunately, that is not the case. I will try to do site development today if I have the time, and if I am not tired, but I still have 2 other projects I also have to work on. I might lower the goals for today. I should be fully functional again on January 4th 2020. This is my first ever surgery."</i></p>
		<p lang="en">I also worked on a home page for the Sourcebase web scripts center to make it an ease of use. I also plan on producing an updated draft of it tomorrow.</p>
		<p lang="en">I didn't do too much today, I worked heavily on another project, and I have been going to bed later and sleeping in until 9:00 am. I will try to do more tomorrow.</p>

		<p lang="en">is not normal. I zoomed the image in as far as I could for the highest quality.

		<p lang="en">I took a hiatus today, and did not do site development. I took today off, and now I am considering it normal to have 2 days off per week when necessary. November was a turning point.</p>

		<p lang="en">I made a decent update today. I finalized work on the HTTP status code reference system for now, but I noticed snapshots 6 and 7 are missing. I am going to try to get community help recreating them in the future, it will be very easy.</p>
		<p lang="en">I also began to work on a new site mode today, which is a legacy mode for the site Digg. I am going to try and add in modes more frequently.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today with the update log, I have gotten it further up to date, and it has surpassed 20000 lines of code, currently sitting at 20300 lines</p>

		<p lang="en">I produced a small documentation only update today, with a minimal debug mode added. Today I worked for over half an hour on semantics for the update log. I was going to do the same for the developer log, but I didn't have the time, and I have lots of projects to work on today.</p>
		<p lang="en">I will resume work on this tomorrow, and try to add in more features.</p>

		<p lang="en">I focused efforts today on getting pages up to date with semantic tags. I have successfully finished the update log semantics (for now) and started working on fixing the developer log semantics, but only made it to blog day 52</p>
		<p lang="en">I have learned about an appointment reschedule, on January 3rd 2019. Here is the quoted text I put out for that day:</p>
		<p lang="en"><i>"I have an appointment scheduled for today. I am having my Wisdom teeth removed in a 9:00 am appointment. I have been told all my life by dentists that my mouth was big enough to not have them removed. Unfortunately, that is not the case. I will try to do site development today if I have the time, and if I am not tired, but I still have 2 other projects I also have to work on. I might lower the goals for today. I should be fully functional again on January 4th 2020. This is my first ever surgery."</i></p>
		<p lang="en">I also worked on a home page for the Sourcebase web scripts center to make it an ease of use. I also plan on producing an updated draft of it tomorrow.</p>
		<p lang="en">I didn't do too much today, I worked heavily on another project, and I have been going to bed later and sleeping in until 9:00 am. I will try to do more tomorrow.</p>

		<p lang="en">I tried to produce a bigger update today, but I failed on many goals. However I did make 1 major accomplishment, which was the complete debugging of my HTML web template.</p>
		<p lang="en">I cleared up time on another project today, and I also realized that I have a bunch of unclosed >section> (formatted differently so it wouldn't be recognized as a nested tag) tags and that this:</p>
		<img src="Issue12.30.2019.png" alt="Bad<Section>Formatting" width="328" height="327"><!-- Don't have to separate tags in image alts for some reason !-->
		<p lang="en">is not normal. I zoomed the image in as far as I could for the highest quality. I actually keep it zoomed in really far (so I can keep over 60 lines on the screen at once) I produced some new years artwork, but had to cancel over 2 dozen updates today. I will try to do better tomorrow.</p>

		<p lang="en">I had a nice visit to my friend Michaels house last night. We played Arkham horror. It inspired me to make a card player system for SNU. I am writing it in JavaScript, as JavaScript is similar to Java, and that is where I wrote my first digital card game. This will be a new SNU mode, that specifically plays card games. I might get Michael as a voice actor, as he was a lot of fun while we played. I am planning on calling the codename for this project "cardStack". Cardstock was an option, but I liked CardStack better.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I worked on the CardStack system, along with minor documentation improvements. I was set back on my goals, and I might not get everything I want done this weekend unfortunately. There is still 1 day left, so there is still some hope for it.</p>

		<p lang="en">Today, I improved CardStack support, Documentation, added in some updates to the SNU Programming center, and added in homepages that should have been added long ago for 2 site scripting test directories.

		<p lang="en">Today in development, I started work on a PodCast system on SNU, along with some more improvements to CardStack. I got a lot done today, as I had a lot of development time, and a steady stream of ideas.</p>
		<p lang="en">I have been keeping updates very consistent and rich lately. I didn't do much else today, other than documentation, and an update to the programming section of SNU, except I did start adding RSS support, even though it is really old.</p>
		<p lang="en">I am holding off CardStack updates for a little bit on 12 pages, as I haven't been adding too much to them when I update them. I have 2 pending actions to the 12 pages (24 pending actions total) but it isn't enough. CardStack seems like a really unique concept, and I don't want to stop supporting it in its prime beginning</p>

		<p lang="en">Today, I produced another big update. I updated CardStack, 12 pages were updated. There were only a few changes done to all the pages, I had to do it, as it takes a while to update 10 pages at once. I also worked briefly on the PodCast system, documentation, and the Favicon collection.</p>
		<p lang="en">During my walk to 4th period today, I thought of a joke page, known as the "1984 Citizen test" which employs false facts, and is inspired by the book nineteen eighty four. This was a joke page, and it came at a bad time, as now the privacy initiative I have been planning on adding starts with an easter egg, and not documentation. I came up with many ideas for the initiative throughout the day, as I have to set it up early now, and I will begin implementing them tomorrow.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today was a decent day with development.</p>

		<p lang="en">I didn't do as much today compared to yesterday. I wrapped up early. I didn't have as much time, and I wasn't very motivated</p>

		<p lang="en">I had a nice visit to my friend Michaels house last night. We played Arkham horror. It inspired me to make a card player system for SNU. I am writing it in JavaScript, as JavaScript is similar to Java, and that is where I wrote my first digital card game. This will be a new SNU mode, that specifically plays card games. I might get Michael as a voice actor, as he was a lot of fun while we played. I am planning on calling the codename for this project "cardStack". Cardstock was an option, but I liked CardStack better.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I worked on the CardStack system, along with minor documentation improvements. I was set back on my goals, and I might not get everything I want done this weekend unfortunately. There is still 1 day left, so there is still some hope for it.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on January 11th 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 347</H2>
		<p lang="en">I had issues with procrastination today. I wasn't able to get all my weekend goals done in other projects, I came pretty close, but I didn't let myself fail website development.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I improved CardStack support, Documentation, added in some updates to the SNU Programming center, and added in homepages that should have been added long ago for 2 site scripting test directories. I will continue to work on CardStack, and other SNU modes, but I have plans to start working with PodCasts tomorrow.</p>
		<p lang="en">I only failed on a few goals, which were for the SNU Programming mode, along with a few weekend projects. I will try to fulfill them next week.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on January 12th 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 348</H2>
		<p lang="en">Today in development, I started work on a PodCast system on SNU, along with some more improvements to CardStack. I got a lot done today, as I had a lot of development time, and a steady stream of ideas.</p>
		<p lang="en">I have been keeping updates very consistent and rich lately. I didn't do much else today, other than documentation, and an update to the programming section of SNU, except I did start adding RSS support, even though it is really old.</p>
		<p lang="en">I am holding off CardStack updates for a little bit on 12 pages, as I haven't been adding too much to them when I update them. I have 2 pending actions to the 12 pages (24 pending actions total) but it isn't enough. CardStack seems like a really unique concept, and I don't want to stop supporting it in its prime beginning</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on January 13th 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 349</H2>
		<p lang="en">Today, I produced another big update. I updated CardStack, 12 pages were updated. There were only a few changes done to all the pages, I had to do it, as it takes a while to update 10 pages at once. I also worked briefly on the PodCast system, documentation, and the Favicon collection.</p>
		<p lang="en">During my walk to 4th period today, I thought of a joke page, known as the "1984 Citizen test" which employs false facts, and is inspired by the book nineteen eighty four. This was a joke page, and it came at a bad time, as now the privacy initiative I have been planning on adding starts with an easter egg, and not documentation. I came up with many ideas for the initiative throughout the day, as I have to set it up early now, and I will begin implementing them tomorrow.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today was a decent day with development.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on January 14th 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 350</H2>
		<p lang="en">Today, updates focused on documentation, the SNU privacy initiative, and policies. I didn't have as much time to develop the site today as I did yesterday, I chose to have a smaller update today.</p>
		<p lang="en">I spent a lot of time writing the 8 privacy articles today with my free time. I will have to cite some sources later, as I had no internet during most of my development time. I had a decent day with development.</p>
		<p lang="en">I am still getting plans for tomorrow, I don't have much planned yet.</p>

		<p lang="en">Today was a short development day. I worked mainly on documentation, and memorial and holiday pages. I have decided from now on to keep holiday and memorial pages to a single directory, and not a new directory each year, so that they can be continuously worked on.</p>
		<p lang="en">I also worked on some other projects, such as another privacy article, and the start of a new call system. Later tonight, I went and gathered resources for the MLK day page, but I was unable to update the articles enough to the standard I wanted them at. I have also decided that I will take 2 days off development of the developer log when it reaches day 299, and update the update log instead for 2 days, so that both pages can reach version 300 on the same day.</p>
		<p lang="en">I was unable to do a lot of todays update due to a lack of internet on my laptop. The Wi-Fi connection for my laptop hasn't been adjusted yet, so I am unable to connect at school. I needed to get other documents ready beforehand.</p>
		<p lang="en">The SNU Calling center is a new upcoming feature. Right now, all that exists are the yellowe pages, which are empty. I also need to fix the graphics, as white does not look good on yellow.</p>
		<p lang="en">I have gotten new ideas, and I will continue further rich development tomorrow (rich development = development with high quality updates per commit)</p>

		<p lang="en">I produced a small update today to improve on yesterdays new libraries. With my new schedule, at the moment I didn't have that much development time during the day, I only had time once before the first class, so it is back to late afternoon/nighttime updates during the week again, hopefully just for now.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I updated the documentation, added in a new idea, added in a business center, updated the malware archive and Favicon collection, and began work on a new CardStack update. I planned 16 things out this morning as an update. I almost ran out of time, but I managed to produce the full update.</p>

		<p lang="en">Today I started out by updating the update log and creating an ideaboard update. That was for the morning. Todays update focuses heavily on SNU CardStack, where I am rebuilding a card game from 2017. I also updated the 3D mode gameviewer, and worked on a new TableTop game mode that hosts and lets users play games that are on the tabletop, like Chess, Monopoly, and more.</p>
		<p lang="en">I ruhed my work in the end, as I really procrastinated a lot tonight. I did manage to get it all done, I had a lot more time today. I am still going strong with website development, it is getting close to being a full month with no breaks now, just like the beginning of last years development.</p>

		<p lang="en">I updated the developer log again today, along with a small site update being made. Todays update focused on documentation. and updates to the MLK memorial and Valentines day page.</p>
		<p lang="en">I didn't get that much done today, as I didn't have as much time or as much to do. Today was mainly a filler update, like yesterday. I hope to make something of the site again soon.</p>

		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 359</H2>
		<p lang="en">I had another shortened development day again today, as I didn't have as much time. I didn't have as much time as yesterday, but I added in 2 features that have been held off for a long time.</p>
		<p lang="en">I briefly started the Twitter and Nitter modes. Nitter is not very well known, but it is a Twitter client without the bad parts embedded into twitter source code. I didn't do much today, as I wanted to have time off today. I have some big plans for the weekend, and I hope I can start and complete the basics of them.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today felt like the end of an era for me for some reason. I finished my senior finals (1/2) I am now entering my last semester at high school.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on January 24th 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 360</H2>
		<p lang="en">I woke up really late today, and didn't have enough time to work on all projects. I was going to make a bigger update today, but I didn't have the time.</p>
		<p lang="en">I worked on a twitter x nitter update today, focusing on improvements to the 2 modes. I found more brand resources, and implemented them to twitter mode, and tweets on Nitter are now called "tweetnits" to distinguish the 2 modes. Today was a decent day for development, but it was very short.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on January 25th 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 361</H2>
		<p lang="en">I didn't put much effort into the update today. I had a lot of different projects I was working on today, and I didn't have much time for a SNU update. I went and searched up some old website data from 2017 and began to implement the important parts into SNU.</p>
		<p lang="en">I have to start preparing for tomorrow, as I have to go to bed earlier, and I need to figure out what my classes for next semester are. I might not have as much free time next semester, but I will try to make it work.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on January 26th 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 362</H2>
		<p lang="en">I produced a small update today to improve on yesterdays new libraries. With my new schedule, at the moment I didn't have that much development time during the day, I only had time once before the first class, so it is back to late afternoon/nighttime updates during the week again, hopefully just for now.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I updated the documentation, added in a new idea, added in a business center, updated the malware archive and Favicon collection, and began work on a new CardStack update. I planned 16 things out this morning as an update. I almost ran out of time, but I managed to produce the full update.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on January 27th 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 363</H2>
		<p lang="en">Today I started out by updating the update log and creating an ideaboard update. That was for the morning. Todays update focuses heavily on SNU CardStack, where I am rebuilding a card game from 2017. I also updated the 3D mode gameviewer, and worked on a new TableTop game mode that hosts and lets users play games that are on the tabletop, like Chess, Monopoly, and more.</p>
		<p lang="en">I ruhed my work in the end, as I really procrastinated a lot tonight. I did manage to get it all done, I had a lot more time today. I am still going strong with website development, it is getting close to being a full month with no breaks now, just like the beginning of last years development.</p>

		<p lang="en">I forgot to mention this yesterday, but the update log now takes up over 1.44 Megabytes in the base 2 system, meaning it can't fit on a floppy disk anymore (Except for a double-sided 2 megabyte drive) the file is getting massive, and it has a very large amount of data on it, and it is starting to become a problem.

		<p lang="en">With SNU Religion today, I added in 3 of the 5 religions I have heard about. I was unable to find material for Christianity, and Catholicism, I made several searches, but couldn't find any results.

		<p lang="en">I have finally incorporated the browser sniffing functionality of SNU into its own page today. I was still in slight pain at the start of the day, but it diminished throughout the day. Today I didn't focus on anything new, just what I was supposed to do yesterday but couldn't.</p>
		<p lang="en">Scripting for browser support templating has increased significantly, and the update log has gained a few thousand lines of code, and hundreds of kilobytes in size. The JavaScript of browser sniffing beta may stop on the update log and move to the browsernose page. Other than documentation, that was it for today. I had a good day in development working on the current projects.</p>

		<p lang="en">I continued work on the browser sniffing scripting on the site today. There is a massive flood going on in Walla Walla, and I don't want to do anything other than browser sniffing and basic documnetation for site development.</p>
		<p lang="en">I am working on getting the Firefox and Safari scripts up to date. I have some plans of reimplementing features from SNU 2.0.x and SNU 1.0 into new releases, and I will start with some gtaphical work tomorrow.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today was a good day for development, but it was mostly template work with no functional elements for the template foundation yet. I am done with the template project for now.</p>

		<p lang="en">I am having difficulty prioritizing the site for its release. I am coming up with new systems, and getting ready for outside help, as I can't develop the entire site by myself. Meanwhile, today I made another browser sniffing update to increase Safari support for the Windows and iOS platforms, add in a sketch to the browserNose page, and create a homepage for the SNU Mascot, plus a Mascot center.</p>
		<p lang="en">I did some brief graphic design to improve the old 2018 sketch of the MediaMan mascot, but after locating the old files, and seeing how it was drawn, I decided to only recolor it today, as I need a better concept before I redo it. The originals will always be kept alongside the redesign. Some update ideas were held off, and I plan to implement more SNU 2.x.x features into SNU 3.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today was a decent day for development with the revival of some older concepts, but not much was done today, and the update lacked some features: a privacy article I was going to write, and some SNU 2 features.</p>

		<p lang="en">Today I worked on brief documentation, adding in the SNU DOM Standard officially, and beginning to write a privacy article on Degoogling. I have some upcoming plans, and I keep forgetting to work on them.</p>

		<p lang="en">I worked on a small update again today. I worked on an article about degoogling, added in a legal resource center, did documentation changes, and updated the Valentines day page. The legal part is going to be used as a tool for one of my classes in school, since I have had no internet at school all year, that way I can have an offline resource, and can add it to SNU.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I was going to try and bring the error count down on the update log, but I decided to save that for when I have a day to do JavaScript updates, as it would involve modifying JavaScript, and I would like to try and add extras along with fixes. I haven't been working too much on core site features for a long time now, and I want to get back into it again. I have a 5 day weekend coming up, so it will be possible soon.</p>
		<p lang="en">I will try to stop updating the Valentines day article, as I have had a major lack of motivation, and a difficulty developing the page. I will have someone in the future help if they are willing to. I am just unable to write it, and after 4 attempts, I am stopping.</p>

		<p lang="en">I have finally incorporated the browser sniffing functionality of SNU into its own page today. I was still in slight pain at the start of the day, but it diminished throughout the day. Today I didn't focus on anything new, just what I was supposed to do yesterday but couldn't.</p>
		<p lang="en">Scripting for browser support templating has increased significantly, and the update log has gained a few thousand lines of code, and hundreds of kilobytes in size. The JavaScript of browser sniffing beta may stop on the update log and move to the browsernose page. Other than documentation, that was it for today. I had a good day in development working on the current projects.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on February 6th 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 373</H2>
		<p lang="en">I continued work on the browser sniffing scripting on the site today. There is a massive flood going on in Walla Walla, and I don't want to do anything other than browser sniffing and basic documnetation for site development.</p>
		<p lang="en">I am working on getting the Firefox and Safari scripts up to date. I have some plans of reimplementing features from SNU 2.0.x and SNU 1.0 into new releases, and I will start with some gtaphical work tomorrow.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today was a good day for development, but it was mostly template work with no functional elements for the template foundation yet. I am done with the template project for now.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on February 7th 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 374</H2>
		<p lang="en">I am having difficulty prioritizing the site for its release. I am coming up with new systems, and getting ready for outside help, as I can't develop the entire site by myself. Meanwhile, today I made another browser sniffing update to increase Safari support for the Windows and iOS platforms, add in a sketch to the browserNose page, and create a homepage for the SNU Mascot, plus a Mascot center.</p>
		<p lang="en">I did some brief graphic design to improve the old 2018 sketch of the MediaMan mascot, but after locating the old files, and seeing how it was drawn, I decided to only recolor it today, as I need a better concept before I redo it. The originals will always be kept alongside the redesign. Some update ideas were held off, and I plan to implement more SNU 2.x.x features into SNU 3.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today was a decent day for development with the revival of some older concepts, but not much was done today, and the update lacked some features: a privacy article I was going to write, and some SNU 2 features.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on February 8th 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 375</H2>
		<p lang="en">I wanted to have a more relaxed day today. I didn't do as much for site development.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today I worked on brief documentation, adding in the SNU DOM Standard officially, and beginning to write a privacy article on Degoogling. I have some upcoming plans, and I keep forgetting to work on them.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on February 9th 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 376</H2>
		<p lang="en">I worked on a small update again today. I worked on an article about degoogling, added in a legal resource center, did documentation changes, and updated the Valentines day page. The legal part is going to be used as a tool for one of my classes in school, since I have had no internet at school all year, that way I can have an offline resource, and can add it to SNU.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I was going to try and bring the error count down on the update log, but I decided to save that for when I have a day to do JavaScript updates, as it would involve modifying JavaScript, and I would like to try and add extras along with fixes. I haven't been working too much on core site features for a long time now, and I want to get back into it again. I have a 5 day weekend coming up, so it will be possible soon.</p>
		<p lang="en">I will try to stop updating the Valentines day article, as I have had a major lack of motivation, and a difficulty developing the page. I will have someone in the future help if they are willing to. I am just unable to write it, and after 4 attempts, I am stopping.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on February 10th 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 377</H2>
		<p lang="en">I created another small update today that finished some parts of the plan from yesterday. I have been having difficulty maintaining core features of the site lately, I have been taking a break and working on small features.</p>
		<p lang="en">I worked on a SourceBase update today, there is little being added to SourceBase but I like to keep it up-to-date with my HTML5 and web development knowledge. Today was another small update day.</p>

		<p lang="en">I hope I can find something better for tomorrow. Site development has been slow lately, but it has also been very consistent, which is better than having several skipped work days each month. I might even try going through ideaboard ideas, as a lot of the things on my comment lists seem to be already done, but I am not sure if they should be removed, I will have to check many pages first.</p>

		<p lang="en">I am recovering from a cold today, and I had to take a sick day from school due to issues with the cold for 2 days while at school that only seemed to get worse. I have recovered a lot today, but I took a lot of time off, so site development wasn't at its peak today.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today was mostly a documentation update, along with the further foundation of the PFOSS exchange, so that I can share more pages publically without revealing the site brand. That is all that I did today. I didn't have the time for anything else. I should be better tomorrow hopefully.</p>

		<p lang="en">I was sick again today, but I still wanted to put a small update out. I had some discussion and viewed some features of the streaming service Hulu with its advertisements, and I got an idea for an expanded add-on for the optional SNU ad system that can improve the experience.</p>
		<p lang="en">I have had a bad cold for several days now, but I should hopefully get better soon. I missed school again today, and spent the day recovering. Site development didn't go too well today, I just needed another day off, just not fully off.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on February 21st 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 388</H2>
		<p lang="en">I didn't have much to go on today, but site development has become a daily thing now, and I don't want to stop here. Today, along with the usual documentation, I worked on the new ad survey system briefly, just to get some of the concept down.</p>
		<p lang="en">I hope I can find something better for tomorrow. Site development has been slow lately, but it has also been very consistent, which is better than having several skipped work days each month. I might even try going through ideaboard ideas, as a lot of the things on my comment lists seem to be already done, but I am not sure if they should be removed, I will have to check many pages first.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on February 22nd 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 389</H2>
		<p lang="en">I had a small set of ideas today to continue site development going, and improve the optional SNU ad system. I have a set of changes ready for tomorrow now as well. Ideaboard features are starting to get implemented now.</p>
		<p lang="en">I was a little tired today, and didn't want to do as much. It is my last day off, and I did what I could. I also want to save more for when I run out of things to do. Today, I did a documentation update, along with adding a new idea to the ideaboard, and an update to the ad system pages that haven't been updated in over 10 months. Today was a decent day for development.</p>
		<p lang="en">I have recently made an error with the developer log snapshots. I forgot to make a snapshot on February 20th, and February 21st has Feb 20th's snapshot date now. The issue was fixed last night, but now there is another missing snapshot that needs to be recreated.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on February 23rd 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 390</H2>
		<p lang="en">I created an update to the advertisement system on SNU today. It was a brief update, but it is passing the time, and improving the completeness of the site. I have some new plans for tomorrow, and I wanted to optimize these pages today.</p>
		<p lang="en">I had a better day today. Today wasn't a mostly documentation update, and the ad system is really getting improved. I have plans for updating the favicon page tomorrow, and making a meme generator.</p>
		<p lang="en">I came up with a ton of ideas at the end of the day to keep development going smoothly again. I have a lot of new things stocked up again.</p>

		<p lang="en">I didn't have too many unique plans for today. Today, I focused mainly on a browser sniffing script update, with the usual documentation, and I also began planning the April Fools jokes for this year. A lot of progress was made in the field of SNU Browser sniffing today, with support for over a dozen new browsers.</p>
		<p lang="en">I had an orientation at the Humane Society today, we went an hour early, thinking it was at 4:00 pm, when it was actually at 5:00 pm. It significantly slowed me down afterwards, and I struggled to produce the update that I was planning comfortably. Browser sniffing planning is getting really advanced now.</p>

		<p lang="en">I was going to do some volunteering this morning, but I slept in too late. Last night, I worked hard for hours on the website, but was not able to get everything done by 10:04 pm. The only thing that was left out yesterday was an update to the Firefox browser sniffing script. Today, I will visit my friend Michael at 4:00 pm, so I have to get some development done beforehand again.</p>
		<p lang="en">I stumbled across some things I forgot to do, such as create a Brave browser sniffing script, and snapshot the Week 57 blog on the same day of creation. I corrected those issues today, and I also worked on the usual documentation, and another major BrowserNose update, with new graphics and documentation. Today was a decent day for development, I took it easier today.</p>
		<p lang="en">Testing for browser sniffing scripts has stopped on the Update log for now, and is being continued on the BrowserNose homepage.</p>

		<p lang="en">I didn't do as much with development today. Window 10 has been a pain for me lately, I have to suffer with it for years as it gets worse and worse. I hope to switch to Linux when possible. Today, I have had excessively high CPU usage (50-80% at all times) from system processes that don't need to be running. It has drained my battery significantly, and wasted a lot of my time. It didn't let me do as much.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I did some tweaks to the sites browser sniffing functions, along with the homepage. I also did some slightly above average documentation improvements. I go back to school again tomorrow, and I really hope battery doesn't prove to be an issue again.</p>
		<p lang="en">I plan on doing new things again tomorrow. The time skipped forward by an hour today, so I lost an hour of development time as well. I really don't know why daylight savings time is still a thing.</p>

		<p lang="en">I didn't have too many unique plans for today. Today, I focused mainly on a browser sniffing script update, with the usual documentation, and I also began planning the April Fools jokes for this year. A lot of progress was made in the field of SNU Browser sniffing today, with support for over a dozen new browsers.</p>
		<p lang="en">I had an orientation at the Humane Society today, we went an hour early, thinking it was at 4:00 pm, when it was actually at 5:00 pm. It significantly slowed me down afterwards, and I struggled to produce the update that I was planning comfortably. Browser sniffing planning is getting really advanced now.</p>
		<p lang="en">Sean Patrick Myrick on March 5th 2020</p>
		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 401</H2>
		<p lang="en">I was really stressed out with time limits when finalizing last nights update. I made it a lot easier for myself today because of this. Today, I worked on a normal documentation update, with some improvements to BrowserNose.</p>
		<p lang="en">I ended up being overloaded with tasks again tonight, as I underestimated how much I needed to do. It is now the weekend, and I plan on going to my friend Michaels house tomorrow. I have some very small plans for tomorrow as a break for the past 2 stressful days.</p>

		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 402</H2>
		<p lang="en">I was going to do some volunteering this morning, but I slept in too late. Last night, I worked hard for hours on the website, but was not able to get everything done by 10:04 pm. The only thing that was left out yesterday was an update to the Firefox browser sniffing script. Today, I will visit my friend Michael at 4:00 pm, so I have to get some development done beforehand again.</p>
		<p lang="en">I stumbled across some things I forgot to do, such as create a Brave browser sniffing script, and snapshot the Week 57 blog on the same day of creation. I corrected those issues today, and I also worked on the usual documentation, and another major BrowserNose update, with new graphics and documentation. Today was a decent day for development, I took it easier today.</p>
		<p lang="en">Testing for browser sniffing scripts has stopped on the Update log for now, and is being continued on the BrowserNose homepage.</p>

		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 403</H2>
		<p lang="en">I didn't do as much with development today. Window 10 has been a pain for me lately, I have to suffer with it for years as it gets worse and worse. I hope to switch to Linux when possible. Today, I have had excessively high CPU usage (50-80% at all times) from system processes that don't need to be running. It has drained my battery significantly, and wasted a lot of my time. It didn't let me do as much.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I did some tweaks to the sites browser sniffing functions, along with the homepage. I also did some slightly above average documentation improvements. I go back to school again tomorrow, and I really hope battery doesn't prove to be an issue again.</p>

		<p lang="en">I was sick again today. I stayed home due to this. Our state recently went into Stage 3 for the COVID-19 pandemic, and it might reach stage 4 soon, as it was only stage 2 just a week ago. I have been struggling to update lately die to the CPU issue, and now my computer wants to install the 1909 update of Windows 10, but for once I have the option to delay the installation. I am finding info and time for it, so I can stay somewhat secure before I switch to Linux. Due to these issues, I didn't have much planned for today, so it is just another filler update, but with another new section of the site: the SNU Font Mill</p>
		<p lang="en">I created a font center today so I can store and test various fonts, including those not yet downloaded by the browser. One of the directory changes that comes with this is a naming change, where lib is spelled as "LIBrary" this is to help aid newer programmers to learn that the term means Library even faster than I did (it took me a few years of computing before I bothered to look it up) This is also helpful if they were to forget. The font mill will be part of 2D mode, but the fonts will be in the root of the distribution. I also did more document exporting today, and documentation changes, but that was it for today. I didn't want to overload myself. i just have a cold, I have had it for a few days now, but it keeps getting worse. It is mainly just stuffy nose with a bad sore throat. I will be fine.</p>

		<p lang="en">I didn't have as much time today, and I am halfway operational, so I made a small update today. I woke up late, started playing late, and had an appointment in the middle of the day, and I decided to relax for 3 hours afterwards. I am also trying to go to bed earlier, so I only had an hour to work today. I didn't want to end my update streak.</p>
		<p lang="en">I have been planning on doing something witb the tel: attribute at some point, but I am trying to figure out how everything works. Today, I didn't have as much time to update, so I mainly worked on documentation, with a small update to the translation service homepage. Hopefully tomorrow will go better.</p>

		<p lang="en">I had more time today, but I was also halfway functional again as well. Today, along with documentation and work on another translation tool update, I made my first use of the tel: attribute, and created a functional suicide prevention center. If the hotline numbers just don't work for people, there is built-in info on why you shouldn't kill yourself, based on personal experience.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today was another simple update day. I am slowly working on adding new features, at the moment I am putting some time into a translation service on a daily basis. I also am going to start online classes soon, once the links are fixed and don't lead to a 404 page. Site development is a little slow at the moment, and I have managed to keep development going on a daily basis for 3 months now. Today was a decent day for development.</p>

		<p lang="en">I created another small update today, putting more work into the suicide prevention center, the translation tool, and the new System directory, which hosts important uncategorized SNU files (at the moment) 1 such file is the sortOrder.css file, which shows info on A-Z Z-A 0-9 9-0 sorting across (coming soon) all languages, and alphabet(a) systems.</p>
		<p lang="en">I am feeling like everything is way too repetitive lately. I only have so many hours in a day, and I don't feel like I am able to do enough. I am having so much downtime lately due to a horrible schedule and missing medication. I was planning on also working on a side project today, but I didn't have the time. Today, I worked mostly on documentation, there is a lot of documentation compared to new content lately, I am sorry for this, but it must be done. I am keeping a better streak than the last time I tried this (with the exporting and separate blog entries, except this time it is for both the update log and developer log) this process usually only takes about 20 minutes a day for all commits related to separate blog and update log entries. Today was a decent day for development, things should hopefully get better soon.</p>

		<p lang="en">Tomorrow is my birthday, I got a restock on my medication today, so I was able to work on site updates. My "anti"virus, AVG (installed out of desparation, but now has just been a pain for a year) today decided to start automatically start quaranting PDFs, whether they are downloaded or created. Specifically 1 PDF, which was the Wikipedia resource I was using for suicide prevention numbers. Other PDFs seem fine, and it is saying that this is particularly not secure, and I don't believe it. Even when copying the text itself, and exporting it, it still detected the PDF, but not the other 7 copies of the same file. It was annoying. I have rambled a little too long on that.</p>
		<p lang="en">Today, I worked on further updates to the suicide prevention page, and documentation, but that is pretty much it. I wasn't too into site development tomorrow, and I needed time to relax. I have been doing small things lately, and hopefully after tomorrow, I can start to do big things again. Today was a somewhat decent day for development.</p>

		<p lang="en">Today is my 19th birthday. Today, I worked on getting as much done as possible before 3:00 pm so that I could celebrate my birthday without having to think about work as much. I made a little bit of an extended update today in the nearly 2 hours I had, including articles on typography, the usual documentation, an ideaboard update, and work on a new online school system, as there aren't any good online school programs, and we need something other than Google classroom.</p>
		<p lang="en">I had a decent day with development today. I recently came up with more ideas that I can work with, and I hope to begin improving site development soon. I finally have a good schedule (at least today) and I may become more productive. I also finally found a good Linux laptop, and I might get it as a late birthday present. It took a year of monthly searches, but I think this might be the one. Site development may slow down during the copy over process.</p>
		<p lang="en">The online school project has been delayed for today. I hope I can work on it tomorrow.</p>
		<p lang="en">I got a new dog at 3:30 pm today. I am keeping it as a foster pet for 2 months while the Humane Society is under quarantine. It is a really nice dog, and the only reason why people didn't ever adopt it is because of how hard it pulls on its leash. I will work on it every day to try and fix this issue. Along with chasing the dog down the street after someone let go (running over 100 meters at full speed) and my birthday party, I didn't get back to work until past 9:00 pm tonight. Some big pros for the website that came out of presents include a 10 terabyte Western Digital hard drive, and a Wi-Fi antenna so I can get internet access in public again, and so I can have internet speeds faster than 4 MB/s again. I had a good time today, and I have a lot to write about in my journal tonight.</p>

		<p lang="en">I messed up my schedule, and ended up having less work time today. Some things were held off, but I still did some other things with time that will benefit me and the website, mainly research and freeing up other projects. I started work on a new electronic online school part of the site, as my goal to create a better online school system, so that we can finally ditch Google Classroom after 5 painful years of another part of the Google monopoly. This school system will be privacy oriented, unlike Google products, and like the rest of SNU. I am still piecing together how it will work and feel.</p>
		<p lang="en">I have also been spending some time with the new dog I am going to foster for the next 2 months. His name is Cobie, and he hasn't been adopted since February, since no-one wants to train him not to pull too hard on his leash. He is a really nice dog, and I enjoy taking care of him. I haven't had a big dog in several years, so it is different than taking care of small dogs. He inspired me to start working on the CompuSmell project again, as he loves sniffing everything, more than any dog I have ever seen. I just don't know yet how it will work. Today, other than the online school project, I just worked on documentation, and that is it for today.</p>

		<p lang="en">After a long period of small updates, even with my bad schedule today, I was determined to make an update that would strengthen the foundation of SNU further. I started and worked on multiple new parts of the site today, including new audio settings, the homepage of the CompuSmell project, updates to the translation service, updates to the anti-sucide page, documentation changes, and updates to the SNU online school system, all in one day.</p>
		<p lang="en">I worked on 6 different projects today (7 if you count file exporting) I still have more planned, I just need to find good days to do it. Today, I made many changes to these pages, and added new ideas in. Site development is still a little slow at the moment, but I am still working on my schedule, and my motivation. I am still working on the foundation of this website, and it is taking a long time to do so by myself. I really feel like I need a break, but I want to keep the daily streak going, and I have no-one to cover for me. Even with all the new features, I feel like today is only a decent day for site development.</p>

Today, I worked on many different things again, which include a revival of work on the SNU CardStack platform (I modernized the homepage, and began to work on a new game) documentation, an update to the SNU web template, sourceBase (1.14 update, version 15 of HTML5) work on a software development kit for the CompuSmell project, and work on the SNU online school system.</p>
		<p lang="en">I made a lot of progress today. However, I did overwhelm myself with a lot of work. In the end, I managed to get it all done. I am making progress on the site again, but it hasn't been feeling like it lately. My schedule isn't fully balanced yet, and I need some time to settle in before I can become even more efficient again. Today was a good day for site development.</p>

		<p lang="en">I wasn't feeling too up to an update today at first, but I still put one out. Over half of the commits were documentation related again, but today I decided to work on modernizing the old Internet Museum, and I started with the entrance and home pages. These pages haven't been updated since SNU 3.05, over 5-6 months ago. They carry old characreristics, such as the old, unchanged default Windows (CR) (LF) indentation, and the poor syntax (but not the basic 1993 HTML syntax, that hasn't been a thing for almost a whole year now, as I use a template now, and I know many more HTML tags than when I started (over 40x more) along with CSS and JS)</p>
		<p lang="en">I noticed a new management problem with keeping a zip format download of the developer log and update log entries besides storage, which is that I have to copy all 8 formats separately, and put them in a separate folder before zippig them, as each file type is assigned to its own folder. The problem this causes is high CPU usage, which leads to faster battery depletion, and also it takes extra development time to do this, especially when a weekly entry is involved. I will learn to work with this. Today was a decent day for development. I hope to work on the Internet Museum more, I still feel like it has potential.</p>

		<H2 lang="en">SNU developer log day 421</H2>
		<p lang="en">I had an extremely laid back update today, with nothing but documentation changes. I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do today, and I also had horrible time management, getting up at 8:00 am, but not getting to work until after 3:00 pm. I was doing other things, like tutoring my little brother with math, and just relaxing.</p>
		<p lang="en">I did nothing but documentation today. I didn't plan anything for today, and I didn't have the time. I began to export ZIP versions of update log and developer log entries today though, but other than that, nothing SNU (new)</p>

		<p lang="en">I wasn't feeling too up to an update today at first, but I still put one out. Over half of the commits were documentation related again, but today I decided to work on modernizing the old Internet Museum, and I started with the entrance and home pages. These pages haven't been updated since SNU 3.05, over 5-6 months ago. They carry old characreristics, such as the old, unchanged default Windows (CR) (LF) indentation, and the poor syntax (but not the basic 1993 HTML syntax, that hasn't been a thing for almost a whole year now, as I use a template now, and I know many more HTML tags than when I started (over 40x more) along with CSS and JS)</p>
		<p lang="en">I noticed a new management problem with keeping a zip format download of the developer log and update log entries besides storage, which is that I have to copy all 8 formats separately, and put them in a separate folder before zippig them, as each file type is assigned to its own folder. The problem this causes is high CPU usage, which leads to faster battery depletion, and also it takes extra development time to do this, especially when a weekly entry is involved. I will learn to work with this. Today was a decent day for development. I hope to work on the Internet Museum more, I still feel like it has potential.</p>
