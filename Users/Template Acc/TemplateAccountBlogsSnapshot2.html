<H1>3 positives for every negative</H1>
<p>On my short walk to class yesterday, I thought of a new idea: 2 positives for 1 negative is a very broken system. The percentages wouldnâ€™t be equal enough, and it would be difficult to decide the exact percentage.</p>
<p>3 positives to 1 negative is better, as the positives would be 75% and the negative would be the other 25% it would also work well as 1-4  (1-9) 1-19 1-24 1-49 1-99.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Be more positive</p>
<p>TL:DR: More positives makes easier math</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 1</H1>
<p>Today is the first day of SNU 3 development. Version 2.0 was a failure, as it wasn't possible to work with the code I had, and it had poor planning. Version 3 is already looking really good</p>
<p>Today, after more HTML testing, I decided that I should try and develop a basic HTML structure for SNU instead of depending on Google sites or Javascript any longer</p>
<p>It is almost like a sign. The HTML hyperlink error lead to so many discoveries, I began looking up how to do all these different things. Now I have</p>
<p>After I successfully managed to embed images, audio, and video into HTML, along with other skills like opening files in other folders, hosting downloads, and opening documents within documents, I moved from my HTML testing ground into the real environment</p>
<p>I am going to try and take it slowly so I don't have to restart again. I think version 3 has a lot of potential. Someday, I will get this site working</p>
<p>Today, I started out with development on the basic site elements such as pseudocode, front pages, trending, and assets. I laid the foundation today</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 2</H1>
<p>Today is another big day in Modern SNU development. I began to work on the profiles for staff and companies. Getting the layout for staff right is important, along with users (coming tomorrow) today, I just established a home base for the sites community</p>
<p>Today wasn't the most exciting day in development, but some important progress was made</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 3</H1>
<p>SNU has received a massive update today, mainly involving user profiles. I have put in lots of effort today into making a template account that mimics what a profile looks like</p>
<p>I think it is a pretty good example. However, it is going to take A LOT of work. So far, just the basic HTML is over 80 Kilobytes in size. I haven't even added any styles or many images yet</p>
<p>I burnt myself out of it for the day, and I began to port SNU 2.0 into the root folder. SNU 2.0 was a failure, but its code establishes a lot of ideas and commitments that I am going to take inspiration from and live up to</p>
<p>Just taking this one day at a time, I will eventually get a good layout finished and a good testing server.</p>
<p>Also, I am going to start using paragraphs and bolding instead of just all headings for my HTML style</p>
<p>One last thing, I have decided to start and keep documentation in the blog section of the profile test account (where you currently are) it may get copied in the future, but the original will remain here</p>

<p>I didn't have the best development day today, not much was added, and I was caught up in a lot of other things. I got burnt out of the project a bit yesterday and it lasted into today</p>
<p>Hopefully tomorrow is better</p>

<p>Today was a better day in development. So the user profile now has an immense amount of sections, currently totaling at 125. Today was mostly an index update, along with adding settings, and fixing up the blog sections</p>
<p>Today was A LOT better than yesterday at least</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 15</H1>
<p>I have now reached the point with this site where it is as functional as SNU 1. I can legitimately say I am browsing SNU. However, this is just the structure. The fun part comes later. However, I haven't outperformed the original SNU yet, however some of its content is finally over to the new site</p>
<p>Today, I worked on making alternates to the rich formatting versions of specific pages, increasing documentation, and working on blogs. I got a lot done again today as well. I also updated the site to version 3.04 and added Big Buck Bunny content in. Since I added over 10 gigabytes today, I have decided I will follow a new update schedule:</p>
<p>I will continue working on the site daily, but I can't make an entirely new version all the time. I can only make a new version every 4 months. This is to conserve the last 490 Gigabytes on my laptops hard drive. This is the way it will be until I get a new computer or a better spot for memory</p>
<P>It's valentines day today btw</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 16</H1>
<p>Today was a pretty good day in development. I was able to do a lot. I added a home page for the game FaÃ§ade, and I actually made a working update log that is up to date. I got burnt out really bad at the end, hopefully tomorrow is better</p>
<p>There are just so many files, it is getting hard to manage, and folder switching is difficult too due to HTML limitations</p>
<p>I got a temporary burn-out on the project for the first time in 4 days, I just need a small break</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 17</H1>
<p>After some research, I decided that I need to put a little less focus on customizing menus and such and work on making the foundation for a good algorithm. There are lots of variables and conditions that go into the SNU algorithm, and it is going to take YEARS to implemeent</p>
<p>I am really hoping I don't have to make another re-write, 3 versions is already alot. It took Microsoft 3 tries for Windows, and they got it on the third try. I haven't been as lucky yet, however none of my projects have been publically released</p>
<p>SNU 3 has a chance, maybe even SNU 1 if Google can give me my website back already. It just won't let me download it</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 18</H1>
<p>I am really happy with the complete makeover of the start page yesterday. It looks great. Today, I re-implemented some older SNU features such as gilding, achievements, and leveling up. I also did a little maintenance to the Valve legends page</p>
<p>I have finally started taking snapshots of separate files on these builds. I should have done this sooner. Now I can make updates to pages separately without copying over the entire directory, which is over 15 gigabytes, and that is not an option anymore due to the space required for frequent backups</p>
<p>Snapshots are now another new way to view older versions of a page, while keeping the modern page in-tact</p>
<p>I went to test Google sites downloading again today. I downloaded the old, old SNU, but not the version 1. Still waiting on that. At least we have SNU 0.1 now</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 19</H1>
<p>Not much of an update today. Today is the last day of my 6 day break. I added a few features such as the cookie jar, and upload center</p>
<p>There is now full access to SNU 0 but it doesn't feel like much. Just a bunch of extra HTML work for nothing. Hopefully people enjoy it</p>
<p>I was going to make a tribute to Pie-Pivot-o, a YouTuber who died a couple days ago due to suicide, but I just didn't have the time</p>
<p>I updated the HTML references so that they easier for me and other developers to access. There is now a 2 way system to the resources and it works pretty well</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 20</H1>
<p>Pretty slow development day today. I have been working on an HTML reference document collection so I can choose page colors easier. It is a big and unique index with lots of beautiful and exciting colors.</p>
<p>Other than that, not much else was done to the site today. I updated the update log, and worked a little on the blog section but that is pretty much it.</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 21</H1>
<p>I had the day off from school today, since it wouldn't be worth going in only to have 20 minute classes. 2 Hour delays on a Wednesday shortened schedule is a no</p>
<p>I was going to try and add content to this site today and make a huge update, but instead, I got distracted with a big video project, schoolwork, and some time on YouTube and reddit</p>
<p>However, I was able to start making the tribute to a recent YouTuber who died, Pie Pivot-o.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do much today</p>
