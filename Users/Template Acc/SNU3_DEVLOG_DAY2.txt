SNU 3.0 Developer log day 2
Today is another big day in Modern SNU development. I began to work on the profiles for staff and companies. Getting the layout for staff right is important, along with users (coming tomorrow) today, I just established a home base for the sites community
Today wasn't the most exciting day in development, but some important progress was made
