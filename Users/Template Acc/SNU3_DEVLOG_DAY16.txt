SNU 3.0 Developer log day 16
Today was a pretty good day in development. I was able to do a lot. I added a home page for the game Fa√ßade, and I actually made a working update log that is up to date. I got burnt out really bad at the end, hopefully tomorrow is better
There are just so many files, it is getting hard to manage, and folder switching is difficult too due to HTML limitations
I got a temporary burn-out on the project for the first time in 4 days, I just need a small break
